{"text":"If you're interested in visiting gravesite(s) of deceased loved ones and\/or ancestors who lived long ago, you'll want to plan carefully before making such visits.  This section provides some tips about how best to prepare yourself physically and mentally so that these trips can become more productive experiences than just emotional excursions into the past.   If possible, try to get permission from those living at present whose ancestors' graves you'd like to visit; however, it's always better to ask forgiveness rather...than asking permission!\nBefore going to any particular location, check first whether or not the site itself may still exist today!  For example, many historic sites were destroyed during World War II by Allied bombing raids over Germany.    In addition,...if you live near New York City, chances are good that most of its older cemeteries would already have been razed away due to urban development pressures since the early 20th century.     Even though you might feel disappointed when discovering that certain locations which once existed now lie under modern-day highways, shopping centers, etc., remember this:  The purpose behind researching one's own ancestry isn't necessarily to locate specific physical places anymore -- although doing so does provide tangible evidence of our shared heritage with others whom we never knew personally....","label":1,"model":"bloomz","source":"wikihow","id":3}

But how do we stay stylish while still being comfortable?  Here at How-To, we've got some tips for you:  If you're going somewhere warm where there's no need for layers (like Florida), then opt for something lightweight like linen pants paired with an oversized t-shirt.   Pair jeans with a crop top and sneakers for a relaxed yet chic vibe.    Wear loose fitting clothing over fitted ones; think about layering as well.     Keep accessories simple... Don't forget sunglasses!  Sunglasses aren't only great protection against UV rays, they're also super fashionable.  You could even consider wearing a pair of aviator glasses for extra style points.    Remember to keep your makeup light during the daytime....   Take care of yourself.  Eat healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables, drink lots of water, exercise regularly, sleep plenty etc..    Have fun!","label":1,"model":"bloomz","source":"wikihow","id":5}
