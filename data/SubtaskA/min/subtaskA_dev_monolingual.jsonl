This program allows users to create vector images as well as raster images such as photographs. \n \n In order to get started we will take some time out to explain exactly what these terms mean so let's begin! \n \n \n \n Vector Images are created when lines are drawn between points instead of pixels being placed side-by-side. These types of images allow designers to scale their work without losing quality because they don't rely upon pixel density but rather line thickness.  \n \n Raster Images are created when dots are arranged into squares called \"pixels\". When viewed closely enough all computer screens display only individual pixels; therefore if you zoomed right in close enough you'd see each dot individually. Because of this fact, any image displayed on screen would appear jagged no matter how high its resolution was set. However, once printed onto paper there wouldn't really be much difference whether it's a low-resolution photo or a high-quality digital print since both would look smooth due to the large number of pixels used per square inch. \n \n Now that we've explained those two different ways of displaying images lets move on...","label":1,"model":"bloomz","source":"wikihow","id":28}

The weather gets extremely chilly outside; however inside offices or houses there are no problems whatsoever because we have heating systems available.   But what if your office doesn\u2019t have any kind of heating system? What then?  Well here\u2019s how you could make sure everyone stays warm enough even without having access to air-conditioners.    Room Heaters  A good way would be by installing some portable heaters like oil filled radiators (which don\u2019t consume too many electricity) into every single cubicle\/work station within...   If this method seems expensive,...    Another option might be getting hold of a small space heater....    You may also try out infrared heaters but these tend to dry out the skin very quickly..     Make sure not to use anything electrical near flammable materials!    Furniture  Try arranging everything neatly together instead of leaving them scattered across different corners of the room.  This will ensure maximum coverage against the cold.  Also place carpets over hardwood floors wherever possible.  Remember - carpeted areas retain heat better than bare wood surfaces do!  Lighting  Darker colors absorb less light compared to lighter ones.  So go ahead and paint those walls black \u2013 it\u2019s actually quite trendy nowadays anyway!!  And remember to turn off unnecessary lights when you\u2019re done working.  It\u2019ll save energy and money both!!!

In fact, there were nearly 1 million jobs available across North America alone at the end of 2012 according to the U.S Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).   This growth can be attributed primarily to two factors -  increased vehicle sales worldwide due largely to economic recovery from recessionary conditions;   and technological advancements which have made vehicles increasingly complex requiring highly trained professionals to maintain them properly.    There was also another factor contributing to this rapid expansion of the auto repair industry:    Many people who had previously worked in other industries such as manufacturing moved their skills to car maintenance because they realized how lucrative these positions could become compared to previous employment opportunities.

It works well because both salt and vinegar are natural disinfectants that kill bacteria and other pathogens; they also help loosen the hardened layers around infected areas.

{"text":" There are many types of game shows on the market, and you need to decide which genre your show will belong to. Types of game shows include:\n\n\nTrivia games like Jeopardy and Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?Puzzle games like Playmania and ConcentrationWord games like Wheel of Fortune and The Last WordPhysical competition games like American Gladiators and Battle DomePerformance competition shows like American Idol and America\u2019s Got Talent;\n, You need to find a way to set your show apart from all the other game shows on the market \u2014 you need to create an angle for yourself. The worst thing you can do is model yourself 100% off of an existing show, but you can mix and match aspects from different shows into a format unique to your own.\n\n\nDo your contestants win prize money or object prizes (like a car or a free trip to the Bahamas)? Maybe they win a donation to a charity of their choice, like many \u201ccelebrity\u201d episodes of established game shows.\nYou might narrow the scope of your game show to a specific theme: for example, a game show specifically about college football, aimed toward a sports-loving audience.\nDo your contestants get the opportunity to try to dig themselves out of a hole by fighting back over a series of rounds, or does the contestant with the lowest score get eliminated at the end of each round?\n\n, You don\u2019t want your game show to be over too quickly, but you don\u2019t want it to drag on forever, either. At minimum, your game should last at least half an hour to ensure that enough questions get asked and answered to make the audience feel like they\u2019ve had a satisfying experience. If your show goes over an hour in length, they might start getting bored and stop paying attention.\n\n, By providing a little bit of structure to the competition, you give the competitive nature of the show a narrative arc. At the end of each round, the audience can measure where the contestants stand in relation to one another; this raises the tension as to who will ultimately win.\n\n\nMake sure each round is long enough to be fully developed \u2014 at least ten minutes each. The number of rounds will depend on the length of the show \u2014 a shorter show might have only two rounds, while a longer show might have four.\nThe rounds should be roughly the same length in time.\nYou can increase the point value for questions as rounds progress, making it more difficult for winners to maintain their lead and easier for the others to catch up; this increases the drama for the audience.\nYou can have a final round that is significantly shorter in length, but provides an opportunity to the contestants to dramatically shift the final score.\nThis might include a single question that is worth a large number or points, or perhaps allow contestants to wager how many points they\u2019d like to risk on their final answer.\n\n, Do you want your contestants to go into head-to-head individual competition, or do you want your show to pit teams of contestants against one another? If you\u2019re going to have teams, do you want to randomly arrange teams from the pool of contestants, or have friends who already know each other apply together as a single team?\n\n, All quiz games, from the weekly trivia game at your local bar to Jeopardy, divide their questions into themed categories.\n\n\nCategories can be as broad or specific as you like, but have a good mixture of the two.\nExamples of broad categories might include: science, history, music, or politics.\nExamples of more specific categories might include: endangered species, World War II, punk music, or U.S. presidents.\nAlthough you can repeat categories from time to time, vary them as much as possible between episodes. You don\u2019t want contestants to be able to predict what types of questions you\u2019re going to ask, and you don\u2019t want your audience to get bored.\n\n, A successful quiz show relies on the consistent production of high quality questions. It\u2019s important that you have a large bank of questions to draw from, and that you do all the research necessary for the show ahead of time, so you don\u2019t get caught unprepared.\n\n\nDevelop more questions than you need. You can always save some questions for the future. This strategy also gives you to option to choose the best, most interesting questions from a larger pool rather than making do with the first handful of questions that came to mind.\nWork ahead of time. Don\u2019t put off research for the last second, as you may run into a time crunch\nOrganize a team of researchers. Draw on the strengths of each individual researcher and delegate specific categories to them. For example, researchers with scientific backgrounds should develop science-themed questions, which researchers with English backgrounds should develop literature-themed questions.\nFollow a research schedule. Don\u2019t allow yourself to get off track during the week if you plan a weekly show. After delegating responsibility to your research team (or simply concretizing the categories for yourself), set deadlines for when questions will be due.\nFor example, if you have a team, you might set a mid-week deadline for a pool of questions three times the size of what you need for the episode. Two days before the episode, you must winnow that pool down to the questions you will actually use that week.\n\n, Although you can find websites where trivia-type questions are provided fairly easily, you should only use them as a last resort, because everyone has access to that same bank of generic questions.Audiences and contestants will be far more engaged with interesting, challenging questions that can\u2019t be found in a generic trivia bank, but which you or your team found through thoughtful research.\n\n, When developing your questions, keep your audience in mind. Steer clear of topics that might bore them; for example, an entire category devoted to the periodic table of elements might get tiresome.\n\n\nConsider who you\u2019re writing this show for. Depending on your demographic, you\u2019ll need to develop different strategies to attract viewer interest.\nIf the show is geared toward teenagers, you can develop questions about pop music, movies, or young adult novels.\nIf the show meant for people who wish to watch academically rigorous competition, focus on the types of subjects taught in university classes: philosophy, political science, etc.\nQuestions about topical events and stories currently in the news can also make your viewers perk up.\n\n, If the questions are consistently too difficult for your contestants to answer, you might see a decrease in potential contestants. Furthermore, the audience will likely grow bored with the show if contestants are consistently unable to field the questions.\n\n\nWhile it\u2019s good to have challenging questions from time to time \u2014 ones that are designed to stump everyone \u2014 the majority of your questions should skirt the fine line between challenging and obscure.\nYou can rank the questions within each category by difficulty, beginning with easier questions and building up to more difficult ones.\n\n, Although the talent of your contestants is the real selling point in this genre of game show, you also want to vary the challenges enough to both keep them on their heels and keep your audience engaged. Before you even begin filming your pilot episode, plan out the challenges you want your contestants to complete for the entire season of your show.\n\n, Many performance competition game shows focus on skills that have a revered tradition with well-loved classics. If your game show falls into this category, the people who watch your show might respond well to watching modern-day contestants pay homage to the tradition of their art.\n\n\nFor a cooking game show, have contestants recreate classical dishes with a long tradition, such as chicken cordon bleu or a croquembouche.For a singing game show, have contestants sing old standards that demonstrate their ability to step into a song imbued with someone else\u2019s legacy \u2014 Aretha Franklin\u2019s \u201cChain of Fools\u201d or Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cNew York, New York,\u201d for example.\n\n, While it takes a great deal of skill to execute a classical standard, asking your contestants to bring their own personality and point of view to a well-loved classic presents an interesting challenge.\n\n\nFor a dancing game show, you might ask competitors to create new choreography for a song that has a beloved performance already associated with it \u2014 Gene Kelly\u2019s performance of \u201cSinging in the Rain,\u201d for example., While you want to design many of your challenges to highlight your contestants\u2019 creativity and innovation, showcasing their technical skills can also enthrall viewers.\n\n\nFor a dancing game show, see how many pirouette turns dancers can do without losing their balance, for example.\n\n, Sometimes, it\u2019s hard to challenge a skilled batch of contestants. A good way to put pressure on them when challenging their technical abilities is to place a time restriction on their task.\n\n\nFor a cooking game show, for example, you might see which contestant can Brunoise dice a pile of vegetables most quickly with an even cut., Though some of the challenges can be about technical proficiency, design other challenges to set contestants up in a way that allows them to showcase their personalities.\n\n\nOn a cooking game show, you might ask contestants to cook a dish that speaks to them from their childhood.\nOn a singing game show, you might challenge the contestants to compose their own songs rather than simply perform those of others.\n\n, In some fields, such as singing and dancing, it may be more difficult to demonstrate innovation because the performers are not necessarily the ones composing or choreographing the pieces. However, if your show showcases a field where your contestants can push the envelope in their industry, design challenges that lead them toward innovation.\n\n\nFor a fashion design game show, ask contestants to create an evening look geared toward women ten years from now.\nFor a cooking show, ask contestants to deconstruct a simple dish or simplify a complex dish.\n\n, Although you want your contestants to be able to demonstrate their own personalities and styles, you also want to see how they can adapt to a wide variety of constraints.\n\n\nFor a dancing game show, have them work in styles from ballet to hip hop to classical Indian folk dance.\nHave cooking game show contestants cook vegan dishes one week, then break down and butcher sides of beef for their own steak dishes the next.\n\n, There are a number of different ways you can test contestants\u2019 strength in that are more entertaining than simply having them lift weights in a gym. Some examples might include:\n\n\nPutting them through a classic childhood exercise like a wheelbarrow race; not only do the contestants have to prove their arm strength over a long distance, but the audience can enjoy laughing along with grown contestants engaging in childish games.Recreate a fun state fair environment by having contestants throw balls at targets for prizes; however, the balls should be heavy medicine balls, and the targets should be far away.\nUse your imagination \u2014 there are any number of ways to have fun while challenging muscle strength.\n\n, You can have them compete head on in simple racing heats, or you can make it a little more interesting by asking them to complete unrelated tasks during their race. For example, contestants sprint for 50 yards, solve a riddle that\u2019s taped to a card at the 50 yard point, sprint back to the starting point, solve a math problem, sprint up a deck of stadium stairs, recite the alphabet backwards, then sprint back to the starting point. Again, you can jazz up the contest however you want, but you want to showcase your contestants\u2019 speed.\n\n, This skill set might have the most potential for entertainment value in a game show setting. You might have contestants engage in an old fashioned pie toss, a dunk tank, or an overgrown, amped up game of dodgeball. A bonus round challenge might be to award extra points to whichever contestant can hit a full-court basketball shot first.\n\n, Obstacle courses raise the stakes by forcing contestants out of their comfort zone. You might set up a military-style outdoor obstacle course, with climbing walls, balance beams, lift-and-carry exercises, and dead sprints.You might aim instead for a funnier tone, booby-trapping contestants with water balloons or flour bombs at points throughout the obstacle course.\n\n\nThe benefit of an obstacle course is that it tests many elements of your contestants\u2019 fitness at the same time, rather than isolating strength from speed from coordination.\nMake sure your contestants are safe at all times. Use rubber pads on any hard walls or objects contestants might run into, and don\u2019t aim projectiles at them that could inflict injury if it made contact.\n\n, Whether you\u2019re trying to sell your game show to a major network or local broadcast television, or even just filming it to upload on Youtube, you will need help from a team of people to make your game show a reality. You will need, at minimum:\n\n\nCamera operators \u2014 you need enough camera angles to show the host and all of the contestants. If you have individual contestants, you might just need two camera operators \u2014 one for the host and one for all of the contestants. However, if you have multiple teams, you might need a camera operator dedicated to each team.\nA production editor \u2014 someone who is familiar with video production software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut.\nA sound technician \u2014 someone who can ensure that the sound quality of all the dialogue on the show is picked up clearly.\nA charismatic host \u2014 the host you choose will set the tone for your show. Whether you pay someone, ask a friend to help you out, or go for it yourself, you need to make sure that the host brings a high level of energy to the proceedings\n\n, The host should introduce each contestant by name, asking them to share a little about themselves. This biographical information can be cut and dry (\u201cMy name is Amy, and I\u2019m an accountant for the city of Austin\u201d) or more whimsical (\u201cMy name is Amy, and I have a cat who likes to go hiking with me on a leash every weekend\u201d).\n\n, Even if your show has been running for a while, you may have new viewers on a given week who are unfamiliar with it. It\u2019s a good practice to introduce the show by briefly explaining the rules and format of the game at the top of each to make sure everyone knows what\u2019s going on.\n\n\nCreate a set script for the introductory rule explanation. This will both ensure that the rules are clearly stated every episode and create a comfortable, familiar segue into the episode for returning viewers.\n\n, If this is a televised show, there will be consistent breaks for commercials \u2014 but even if your show is online, it\u2019s a good idea to allow resting spots every once in a while, ideally between rounds.\n\n\nWhen a round ends, the host should recap the scores at that point in the game.\nThis is a good time for the host to comment on how the game is going so far, or to ask the contestants how they\u2019re feeling about their performance.\nThese little breaks will give both the audience and the contestants time to reset for the next round of competition.\n\n, If your show has a format that changes from round to round, make sure your host explains the new rules at the beginning of each round. You might have a stable format for each different round, like Jeopardy or Chopped, or you might have completely different challenges in each round from week to week, like Project Runway or Top Chef.\n\n, The audience wants to like the people they\u2019re watching, especially the host who remains a constant from episode to episode. Make sure the host is personable throughout, joking with contestants, complimenting them when they do something well, and allowing them to display their personalities.\n\n, As each episode draws to a close, the host should thank the contestants for participating and congratulate the winner on their victory. Take a brief moment before the show ends to thank the audience for watching the show, and invite them to join you again for your next episode. Tell them the date, time, and channel on which the show appears so they know exactly when and where they can find the next episode.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":533}

Use the cone to apply the design as chosen., Mix 1 teaspoon sugar with 3 teaspoons lemon juice to prepare the mixture. About twenty to thirty minutes after the paste is applied, the henna will lose its shine and the mud will dry and begin to crack.\n\nApply the lemon and sugar mixture gently with a clean cotton patch to that part where henna has been applied; so that the henna does not get dry and fall off. This lemon sugar mixture will create protective \u201cglue\u201d between your skin and the henna. Be careful not to over saturate the paste as designs can run and bleed together. Apply the mixture 2 to 3 times.\n\n, Wrapping need lots of absorbent tissue to wipe up the perspiration.\n\nStart wrapping tissues around your hand like a mummy.\nWrap plastic over the tissues.\nTape the wrap down with packing tape.\n\n, Before you are ready to remove the paste and wraps, hold the area over steam for 10 minutes. A pot of boiling water or tea kettle works well or heat 2 to 3 cloves on an iron pan and put your hands over its fumes. The extra heat and steam help to deepen the stain color., After the paste has been on your skin for 6 \u2013 12 hours it is ready to be removed. Peel off wrappings and scrape off the paste. Using a paper towel and vegetable oil (corn, olive, and canola) or lemon juice, gently rub off the dried henna paste if it is sticking to the skin. Do not use water to remove the paste, it can ruin the tattoo., Once you have unwrapped and removed the dry henna paste you will see an orange-yellow tattoo stain left on your skin. The tattoo will deepen into a richer reddish-brown tone over the next 48 hours.\n\nThe final color is reddish brown and can last anywhere from one to three weeks depending on the quality and type of henna paste applied, as well as where it was applied on the body (thicker skin stains darker and longer than thin skin). Moisturizing with natural oils, such as olive, sesame seed, or coconut, will also help extend the lifetime of the tattoo, as skin exfoliation is what causes the henna tattoo to fade.\nIt is best to avoid water for the first 24 hours.\n\n, Corn, canola, or olive oil all work well. Avoid using any petroleum products such as baby oil or Vaseline as they will contribute to the demise of your stain.\n\nAvoid excess rubbing of the area.\nAvoid shaving over your henna\/mehendi stain. Shaving removes layers of skin.\n\n, The color becomes darker within 2 hours. But that color will only last for 2 days. It is the last possible remedy. Wash your hands with liquid soap to keep the mehendi design for a longer period. Avoid too much rinsing of the hands.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":534}

{"text":" You should always prepare your hair for cornrows\/weave prior to executing the style. Wash your hair as you normally do, and give it a good conditioning treatment as well. Make sure that your hair is totally dry before starting the cornrow process.;\n, To create the base to sew your weave onto, you have to braid your head in a series of cornrows. To do this, you\u2019ll need a wide tooth comb, a fine tooth comb, and a hair pick. You will also need 2-3 large hair clips to hold your hair away from your face, and a detangle spray of some sort (3 parts water mixed with 1 part oil in a spray bottle works well).\n\n, When you add your weave, you\u2019ll place it in layers around a part in your natural hair. Your part is the exposed area of the scalp, and is typically located down the center of your head or slightly off-center. Choose the location of the part, and separate out \u00bd-inch sections of hair on either side of it. Pin the rest of your hair back using the clips.\n\n\nYour part only needs to go about halfway back on your head.\n\n, To show your part, you will braid two rows of hair on either side of the part, away from each other. Start with one of the \u00bd inch sections of hair, and separate a small piece about \u00bc of an inch thick on one of the ends. Braid this in a french braid towards the ear on the same side of the part. Braid this strand about \u2154 of the way down, leaving the ends loose (they will be incorporated into a larger braid later on).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Work down both sides of the part, braiding small french braids \u00bc-inch wide. Remember that the braids should always go towards the ear on the side of the part they are on; this will expose the straight part down the center. Because you won\u2019t be able to french braid each strand all the way, the ends should stick out after you\u2019ve braided all the hair near the scalp. Each of the strands that are sticking out will be the start of a row of braids going all the way around your head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, The first braid you will complete is a small braid that wraps around the outer edge of your face, head, and to the nape of your neck. The perimeter braid will have two starts - on either side of the part - but you will combine the ends of the braids together at the nape of your neck. Take your hair out of the hair clips, and section off a strand of hair \u00bc-\u00bd inch thick all the way around the outer edge of your head. Starting with the edge-braid from your part, braid as far as you can around the edge of your head. Then, do the same on the other side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might combine the perimeter braids off to the side rather than directly in the center on the nape of your neck, if your part is off-center.\nKeep the braid as tight as you can, and as close to your scalp as you\u2019re able.\n\n, Each of the braids you began on either side of your part will continue on to form full braids that wrap around your head. This means that from a birds-eye-view of your completed head, there will be concentric circles formed around your part. Follow the pattern of the perimeter braid, by sectioning off thin pieces of hair around the outer edge and working in. Go to the next braid closest to your hairline, and braid on either side of your part towards the back of your head.\n\n\nContinue spraying your hair with the oil\/water mixture or your detangler spray to make braiding easier.\nYour braids should be very tight and may hurt while braiding, but shouldn\u2019t be painful when completed.\nThe braids will likely become quite thick about halfway through, because of all the hair you gather. Don\u2019t be worried if because of this your braids are uneven.\n\n, Work inwards on your braids, away from your part. Each of the small braids you started on either side of your part should serve as the start for each new braid. If you run out of part-braids though, you can create more near the part on the back of your head. Tie off all the ends and tuck them into\/under the finished braids so as to hide the tails.\n\n, For your weave, you\u2019ll at need at least two packages of wefts of human hair in a color coordinating your natural hue. You\u2019ll also need curved sewing needles, weave thread that matches the hair color, a wig cap, and a pick or fine tooth comb for separating sections of hair. When you finish weaving in a weft of hair, you\u2019ll cut the excess with a pair of shears, so have those on hand as well.\n\n, Get your special weave-thread out, and cut a piece that is 2\u20133 feet (0.6\u20130.9\u00a0m) long. Thread one end of the string through your needle, and pull it so that both ends are even. Then, wrap the ends of the thread around the tip of your finger, and tie them together in a knot. This will form a loop on which your needle is strung. Cut the excess thread off that is left over from tying your knot; try to cut it as close to the knot as you are able, so as to make it as discreet as possible when woven into your hair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t cut too much thread to start, as the longer your thread, the more tangles and knots that are likely to be formed.\nYou\u2019ll probably run out of thread often, so you\u2019ll have to repeat the aforementioned process each time that happens.\n\n, Pull your wig cap out and stretch it out, sliding it over your head. Cover your entire hairline all the way around; the wig cap should go over your ears, forehead, and the nape of your neck as bit so as to make sure your braids are completely covered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Start at the beginning of your perimeter braid near the part, and pull the needle under the braid and through the other side, pulling the thread taut against the knot. Then, pull the end of the knot out just a bit and pull the two strings apart to expose the loop. Wrap the needle around one edge of the loop twice, and pull it through the center of the loop to create the base knot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Measure about 1-inch down the perimeter braid from the first knot you made, and repeat the process. Hook the needle under the braid, pull it through the other side, and tug to pull the loose thread tight. Before the thread between the two knots has been tightened all the way though, wrap the needle around it twice near where you inserted it, and pull tight. This will give you your second knot. Repeat this same process all the way around the perimeter braid.\n\n\nEach knot should be about 1 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) apart from each other.\nMake sure that your knots and thread are pulled tight, so that your cap is firmly attached to your braids.\n\n, When you\u2019ve sewn the wig cap around the perimeter braid, you\u2019ll complete the \u2018loop\u2019 by sewing around the outside of your part. Starting from your last knot on the perimeter braid, skip up to the next row of braids on your head. Repeat the knot-tying process, and then go up to the next row. By the time you\u2019ve sewn around the part, you should have a large \u2018U\u2019 shape of knots. Make sure that each knot is at least 1-inch away from the center part. Finish off by tying two knots at the base of your sewing, where you started on the perimeter braid.\n\n\nThe finishing knots should be the same as the other knots you\u2019ve been sewing the whole time.\nCut the extra string off as close to the knot as you are able, without cutting the knot.\n\n, Take your shears and cut up along your part to split the wig cap. You\u2019ll be removing all the excess fabric around the edge of your sewing (the part that went over your forehead, ears, nape of your neck, and the covers your part). Once you\u2019ve cut up your part, cut all the extra fabric off as close to the edge of your thread as possible, without getting close enough to cut the knots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you accidentally cut the thread or a knot, you\u2019ll have to remove what work you\u2019ve done and start over with a new wig cap.\n\n, The first extension that you will measure and apply is the piece that goes around the perimeter. Take your extensions out of the package, and open one weft so that all the hair is exposed. Starting at the beginning of your perimeter braid, hold the extension in place, and wrap it around your head. Hold it to the perimeter braid the entire time to make sure it is the right length. When you get to the end of the perimeter braid on the other side, measure a little extra hair, and then trim it to fit.\n\n\nPlace this piece of perimeter-extension off to the side, so that you don\u2019t misplace it or confuse it for another section of hair.\n\n, The second major section of hair you need to measure is the piece that will go around the \u2018U\u2019 shape of your part. Hold the end of the extension over the beginning of the \u2018U\u2019 shaped part near your forehead, and wrap it around where you have already knotted. When you get to the end on the other side (back to your forehead), add a little extra length to your measurement, and then cut the piece of extension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep track of this extension, and make sure you don\u2019t confuse it with the perimeter extension.\n\n, You\u2019re going to be working with a long strip of extension, but you won\u2019t be able to use all the necessary thread in a single shot. Cut a piece of your weave thread that is 5\u20136 feet (1.5\u20131.8\u00a0m) long, and use the same process as you did for your wig cap by threading it through the needle, matching the ends, and tying them together in a knot. Cut off any excess string.\n\n, Every time you section out a new piece of extension to sew on, you\u2019ll have to create a knot to secure it. The extension is made up of two primary parts: the strands of hair, and the weft which holds them together. Stick your needle through the weft at the very beginning of the extension to secure it. To tie your first knot, you\u2019ll wrap the needle around, pull it through the weft a second time, wrap the loop that is formed around the needle twice, and pull the needle through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe knotting process involved is the same as you used to sew your wig cap to your cornrows.\nYou should have plenty of excess thread when you\u2019re finished tying your not; don\u2019t cut this, as you will be using it to weave your extension to your head.\n\n, Start at the very beginning of your perimeter braid near your part, and insert the needle through the wig cap, under the perimeter braid, and up through the other side. Pull it tight to bring your extension piece close to your head. Then, make your first knot by wrapping the needle\/thread around the weft (not through it) and repeating the same knotting process as you used for sewing your cap. Repeat your knot twice to secure the extension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll only double-knot the extension at the very beginning.\n\n, Using the exact same process as you did to sew on the wig cap, work around your head sewing on the extensions that attach to the perimeter braid. Make each knot about 1-inch apart, and hold the extensions taut so that they are securely attached to your head. Do this all the way around your perimeter braid until you\u2019ve made it to the very end, on the opposite side of your part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful not to tie strands of hair into the knot.\nTrim off any excess that you might have once you have completed sewing on the perimeter extension.\n\n, To finish off the \u2018border\u2019 of your hair, you\u2019ll have to sew your extension piece around the edge of the \u2018U\u2019 shape that your wig cap forms around your part. Start by preparing a new piece of thread and attaching it to the end of the weft. Then use the exact same process as explained above to sew the extension to the braids\/wig cap around your part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrim off any extra that you might have at the end.\n\n, Starting at the second row of braids (the second to the perimeter braids) you should begin filling in the space on your head with the rest of your extensions. Continue the same process as above, except that when you get to the end of your row (on the opposite side of the perimeter braid), you should use the \u2018fold over\u2019 method to begin an additional row. This means that instead of cutting off the excess extension when you reach the end of a row, you fold it back on itself and begin sewing the new row directly above it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways sew a knot directly over a fold when you fold over a section, in order to make it lay flat. It is helpful to do this twice, to make sure it is 100% secure.\nDon\u2019t measure and cut your pieces prior to sewing additional rows, because the fold-over method will make it easier to continue working with the same weft for a large portion of your head.\n\n, Work around your head, using the exact same process of sewing your weave to your cap\/braids as you have been. Remember to always double knot over a fold or the beginning of a weft, to properly secure it. When you have finished filling in your head, trim off any excess that might hang over the front., If you\u2019ve done all of your sewing correctly so far, you should be left with about 1-inch of exposed braids all the way around your part. Sewing your weave onto this section is similar to when you originally braided it, as you will be working with small sections away from the part. Measure the exposed braid, and cut off the same amount of your weave. Sew each small section (about 1-inch wide) onto the exposed braid. This means that you will have many small pieces to sew, and each should run somewhat parallel to your forehead. Use the exact same process, making sure to double-knot both the beginning and end of each thread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might be helpful to have several needles with thread prepared before starting this, because you\u2019ll be working with so many small pieces of weave which may be difficult to do with a single long piece of thread.\nAs the layers build, your part should look more and more natural, and the weft of each piece of extension should begin to be covered up.\n\n, When you\u2019ve sewn on extensions to all the small braids along your part, you should be left with a space in the back that is still open. To fill this in, you\u2019ll have to prepare a special piece of your weave. Measure the space that you have to fill, and cut a piece of your weave that is twice that length. Start with your regular double knot at the end, and then roll the weave in to create a small circle. Create an additional knot by looping around the two layered sections of weft, and pulling it tight. Continue rolling and knotting the extension until you have finished the whole piece.\n\n\nWhen you tie the last knot, pull the needle through all of the layered wefts to secure them together.\nCut the excess string off when you\u2019re finished tying it.\n\n, Turn your closure piece upside down so that the weft is facing the ground, and the hair is upwards. Begin flattening the hair so that it falls down over the top of the rolled up weft. Because of the roll that you created, the hair should fall evenly around it, hiding the weft and your sewing. It may be helpful to use a flat iron on the hair to get it to cooperate with what you\u2019re trying to get it to do.\n\n\nSecure the ends of the hair with a small elastic to making sewing it to your scalp much easier.\n\n, Turn your closure piece back over so that the weft is exposed, and insert your needle and thread through it to tie your regular double knot. Bring your closure to your scalp, and place it where you want it to go. Insert your needle through a braid or a piece of weft from another extension nearby on your scalp, and pull it tight to create your regular knot. Continue doing this in a circular movement around your closure piece, until you\u2019ve gotten back to the beginning.\n\n\nCut off the excess string, remove the elastic from your hair, and you\u2019re done!\nAdjust the strands of your closure piece to cover up any weft that may be visible.\n\n, Attaching your weave to your head is now completed, so you have the option of cutting and styling it to your personal preference. Keep in mind that your cut is permanent since your hair isn\u2019t going to grow in, so be very careful about cutting your hair. Maintain your weave regularly, but avoid washing it too often as this may loosen up the ties and your wig cap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":536}

{"text":" This will come with a huge power wire, a short ground wire, a remote wire, and many times an inline fuse and various connectors to help keep the install organized and looking clean. Some stereo shops have huge spools of wire available by the foot. This is another cost effective alternative to buying a wiring kit, if you know the dimensions of your car.;\n, You can find a hole somewhere in the bottom right of the firewall. Don't connect the power wire to the battery or the amp just yet.\n\n, You'll need to stay within 2\u20133 feet (0.6\u20130.9\u00a0m) of the amplifier to maintain the best ground connection. A way you can do this is pull up the carpet and scrape the metal until it is bare metal with no paint left on it. If the amplifier is to be mounted in the trunk, many times bolts from the suspension can be found directly above one of the rear wheels. These suspension components usually bolt directly to the frame, making them an ideal grounding point.\n\n, There is a blue wire with a white stripe hanging out of the back of the deck known as the remote wire. The remote wire is a simple 12v signal that the cd player outputs to tell the amplifier to turn on.\n\n,, If your cd player does not have a \"Subwoofer Output\", or if you are using a stock cd player, you will need a device called an inline converter. It's a small box that has 4 input wires and the 2 necessary RCA output that will run to the amplifier. It takes the high level speaker voltage and drops it to a low level signal the amplifier can process. The 4 input wires can be connected to the rear speakers (+ and - for left and right).\n\n, RCA cables should be run down the center of the car as RCA cables can pick up sounds from wire looms and also air con vents power wires.\n\n, Gauge isn't extremely important here, as long as the wire is copper, the resistance-per-foot is in the mili-ohm range, meaning there will be minuscule, if any, voltage drop across the wire.\n\n, There are many different types of enclosures (sealed, vented, bandpass, infinite baffle, etc.). There are numerous articles explaining the pros and cons of each type of enclosure, far too many to list in this article. If you really want the best response possible, your subwoofer manual will list the ideal enclosure volume for each type of enclosure. If you don't want to go through all of the volume calculations, just buy a box slightly bigger, and stuff it with pillow stuffing from walmart until the subs respond the way you want them to.\n\n, For example, if you have an amp that is 500w @ 4 ohms, and 1000w @ 2 ohms, you'll want to try to run your speakers at 2 ohms. Two 4 ohm subs can be wired in parallel to achieve this. If you're new to the impedance calculations, many amplifiers will have specific wiring diagrams in their manuals to assist.\n\n, If your amp kit came with an \"inline fuse holder\", you'll want to find a nice location to mount it in your engine bay. Once it's secure, cut a length of the power wire to reach the fuse, and connect it to one side of the fuse holder. The other side (the side you just cut) is stripped and connected to the other side of the fuse holder.\n\n, There's nice ring connectors and even new battery terminals you can buy (and sometimes come with the amp kit), that make the battery connection much more solid, and looks better too.\n\n, Then under the hood clamp the wire down to the battery. A word of warning, sometimes you'll see a nice big spark the first time you touch the power wire to the battery. Don't worry about it! This is the amplifier charging the huge capacitors contained inside.\n\n, This is where the output of the amplifier peaks and stays there for a split-second. This is bad for the subwoofer because it holds the cone (the big circle part!) in it's fully extended or fully compressed state for the duration of the clip. Not only are you not producing a single decibel of sound during this microsecond, but you're also working the voice coil very hard and damaging it. A good rule for beginners is to play a nice loud song of your genre at your cd players 3\/4 volume setting. Now, with the gain at zero, turn it up until it's obvious that it isn't getting any louder. The gain knob isn't a \"volume\" knob by any means. A gain knob should usually never be at it's full position.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":538}

If you have found butter for a bargain price and don't want to overlook the savings, consider freezing the bulk of any excess butter.\n\n, Butter easily absorbs the odors of other foods, thus it's important to provide a guard against this possibility., Alternatively, if you don't wish to wrap the butter, place it straight into the sealed container in its original packaging; the seal will prevent the transfer of odors and exposure to air.\n\n\nLeft unopened, salted butter will keep for several weeks., Once you start to use it, aim to work through it quickly.\n\n,, While butter can be frozen as a whole block, it is probably more useful to cut it into usable chunk sizes, which will make it easier to thaw quickly and provide just the amount you need each time.\n\n, Ensure that the foil completely covers the butter and overlaps for added protection.\n\n, Alternatively, place it inside a freezer-proof container which is airtight.,, Unsalted butter has a shelf life of three months in the refrigerator (unopened), while it can be frozen for up to six months.Once opened, it will keep for two to three weeks in the refrigerator., If you cannot consume it within this time, you will need to freeze the unsalted butter, to ensure that it stays fresh for longer.\n\n\nWrap the butter well in foil to avoid other flavors from mingling with it.\nBefore wrapping, consider cutting it into smaller chunks that you can remove for use as needed.\nPlace a resealable freezer bag over it to prevent odor penetration.\nPlace in the freezer. Keep it away from any frozen food that might impart a strong odor. As noted, unsalted butter will keep for up to six months in the freezer.\n\n, Butter spoils quickly at room temperature, due to its high water content., The salt as a preservative will help the butter to stay fresher a little longer.\n\n, Store it in a cool, dark and dry cupboard or pantry when not in use. When on the table, keep the lid of the butter dish on when the butter is not being used.\n\n\nAir is the source of turning butter rancid. Hence, keeping the lid on helps to slow down this process.If you like the idea of room temperature storage, consider getting a European storage crock. These come with a water seal that keeps the air out, the moisture in and retains the freshness of the butter for longer (up to two weeks).Inquire about this at your local kitchen store, or check online for providers.\n\n, The butter will go rancid very quickly. For room temperature butter when it is hot, remove only the needed amount from the refrigerator a half hour to an hour before use and place in the butter dish\/keeper; leave to warm at room temperature, with the lid firmly on. Then transfer to the table. Discard what has not been consumed at that meal.\n\n, Ghee has had the milk solids removed. This means that it is less likely to go rancid and has a longer shelf life.\n\n, Provided the room temperature is normal and not too hot, and you intend on using the ghee quickly, it is usually fine to store it at room temperature.If ghee has been made properly and is stored properly, it is possible to store it at room temperature for several decades.However, this is not advisable, as foods are best consumed within a short period of time of their production. If any moisture or milk solids remain in the ghee, it will not store well for a long period of time; it must be pure butter fat for it to stay fresh at room temperature.The container used to hold the ghee must be airtight, opaque and waterproof.Pickling crocks or porcelain jars\/earthenware jars can be used for short-term room temperature storage.Colored glass jars or commercially specific hermetically sealed containers can be used for longer-term room temperature ghee storage., For long-term freshness and absolute certainty, it is a good idea to keep ghee refrigerated, especially once opened, and especially if you've made it yourself.Ensure that it is in an airtight container; it will still absorb the odors of aromatic foods around it.\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":542}
{"text":" especially the section about physically removing the starter from the engine compartment. This should help you decide whether to take the vehicle into service vs doing this yourself.\n,, You will be in and under the wheel well most of the time., you can remove the plastic rivets with a large screwdriver or stretch the rubber guards over the heads of the rivets., (just aft of the strut). The starter will not fit through this space without moving this brake line first., It is held in place by an O ring. twist and pull the upper section up. It comes out reasonably easy, plug the top of the bottom section with a paper towel as to not contaminate the transmission fluid.,, You will have to go under the truck and come in from behind the starter through a maze of brake lines etc. The swivel headed ratchet makes this job MUCH easier. Using a 12 to 14 inch (30.5 to 35.6\u00a0cm) extension and the same 14mm socket and swivel ratchet remove the top bolt., Depress the plastic locking key and slide the plug out. Fortunately this removed easy, because there is little room to maneuver and no room to use pliers. If you had to use force there is no room for leverage., THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE JOB. I was unable to do it myself and ended up having a Toyota Service supervisor come to my home and assist me. He said only two of his three techs are able to perform this task. The starter needs to be removed gears first, through the wheel well opening, it needs to be lifted (gears up) and rotated toward the opening so that it is removed not quite horizontally. As the starter is moved toward the opening it has to be rotated so the positive battery lead bolt can clear obstructions. The starter is then advanced in position and rotated opposite direction. Advance the starter in position and wiggle it in position until it can be removed. This is MUCH more difficult than it sounds. As I said I was unable to perform this task., You will need an impact driver to take the starter apart and check the bushes (also called lunge contacts). The brushes are usually just over an inch long and spring-loaded, if they appear to have plenty of carbon left then look to your stator. Bluish burns on the copper windings indicate bad spots, and the starter should be replaced. As difficult as this job was, replacing the starter is worth every dime. After market starters are approx. $100. Toyota I believe is closer to $300., wiggle it around until it goes into the engine compartment, maneuver the starter until the gears go into the flywheel housing then line it up and push it into place. It is difficult to tell whether the gears and flywheel mesh, but rotate the starter back and forth and the gears should mesh. Using a 12\u201314 inch (30.5\u201335.6\u00a0cm) flat piece of anything, prop the starter up so that you may start the bolts into the starter housing. I had better success with the lower bolt first, and pulling the starter up to the flywheel housing cautiously to check the gear mesh. Leave the lower bolt loose and start the top bolt. After re-installing the starter, I had difficulty tightening this top bolt. I was able to reach this bolt through the wheel well (with no extension or flex socket) for final tightening. Tighten the bolts checking the gap between the flywheel housing and the starter to ensure the gears meshed properly. If they are coming together unevenly remove either bolt, loosen the other bolt and rotate the starter back and forth until it goes into place. The limited access to the starter makes this process more difficult because of lack of mobility of the starter. Repeat the re-bolting process, and tighten down the bolts. I do not know the torque values if any. I use the tight is tight, too tight is broke, method., Rebolt the brake line bracket, replace the negative battery lead and start the truck. If the truck starts, shut it off, remove the jack stands, replace the wheel, remove the jack and tighten down the wheel bolts.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":543}
{"text":" If you plan on driving, don\u2019t drink enough alcohol to raise your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08, which is the legal level for intoxication in every state., Consider using an online calculator, such as the one available at this link. Factors influencing BAC include your gender, weight, and what type of alcohol you drink.The calculator can be a useful tool, but don\u2019t rely on it to be completely accurate.\n\n, Medications affect people differently, so make sure that any prescription (or non-prescription) drugs you take won\u2019t impair your ability to drive., Instead of risking a DUI, call a taxi or ask a friend or family member to pick you up if you\u2019re too impaired to drive. The consequences of a DUI conviction far outweigh the cost of a cab ride.\n\n, Every state has laws that govern driving under the influence. There are certain basic DUI elements that you\u2019ll find in these laws, such as:\n\n\nBAC intoxication levels, some of which can trigger stiffer penalties\nthe possibility of jail time\nfines\nthe possibility of suspension or restriction of driving privileges., This will enable you to learn the specifics of what constitutes a violation of the law where you live. It will also let you know the possible penalties involved. You can look up the laws for your state here.\n\n, If you\u2019ve been arrested for a DUI, the police will most likely let you know some of the details of your arrest, such as your BAC level. If they don\u2019t tell you immediately, you should have access to this information within a few days. Once you have this available, compare it to what you\u2019ve found in your state\u2019s DUI law, to get a better idea of what you're facing. Knowing this may also influence your decision as to whether or not you want to retain an attorney.\n\n, If a police officer stops you, and believes you may be under the influence, he or she will normally administer tests at the scene of the stop. Try to recall as much about this as you can. The typical tests are:\n\n\nNystagmus test. You\u2019ll be asked to shift your eye gaze from one side to another while the officer shines a light in your eyes.\nWalk and Turn (WAT) test. The officer will ask you to walk heel-to-toe on a line, while giving you other instructions.\nOne Leg Stand (OLS) test. You\u2019ll have to stand on one leg for 30 seconds, so the officer can assess balance and coordination.\n\n, If a police officer believes you\u2019re driving under the influence, in all likelihood he or she will want you to take a chemical test. This is usually a breath test, but also could involve a urine or blood sample, depending on the circumstances. All states have laws that require you to take the chemical test (\u201cimplied consent\u201d laws). As with the balance tests, try to remember as much as possible., As soon as you can, make written notes of everything the officer may have told you, and any responses you gave, from the time you were stopped until you were released. This includes how well you believe you did on the balance tests, and what you saw or heard during the chemical test. If the officer said or did anything to imply that you may have been stopped for something other than suspected DUI (such as race or gender), the evidence collected may not be admissible in court. This is also true if the officer didn\u2019t read you your rights after you were arrested., Some attorneys advise against taking any of the field sobriety or chemical tests if you think you'll fail. Depending on your state, you may not be obligated to take the field tests or preliminary breath test at the scene of the stop. But be aware of the following:\n\n\nIf you don't take the formal chemical test at the police station or hospital, this could lead to a legal inference that you're guilty, which can be used against you in court.\nThere are separate penalties for refusing the formal chemical test, such as loss of driving privileges, fines and possibly jail.\nYou could end up with two convictions: DUI and refusal to take the test., If you have been arrested for DUI, you might want to consider hiring an attorney or having an attorney appointed for you. A criminal defense attorney can help you challenge your stop and arrest and will help you craft and make logical legal arguments.\n\n\nIf you can afford a criminal defense attorney, hire one who concentrates on DUI defense. There are plenty of DUI attorneys out there so look for one with excellent communication skills, a good record of success, and great ethics. In general, a DUI defense at this stage will cost between $1,000 and $5,000. For more information on hiring a criminal defense attorney, look here.\nIf you can't afford an attorney but you still want one, the law requires that you be appointed a public defender. If you have not had a court appearance yet, invoke your right to counsel by telling any law enforcement official that you would like an attorney and that you cannot afford one. If you have already had a court appearance, ask the judge to have an attorney appointed for you.\n\n, In order to stop a driver, an officer must have \u201cprobable cause\u201d, such as erratic driving, for example. If probable cause didn\u2019t exist, the stop could be declared illegal, and the evidence against you may be inadmissible in court.You should also note that some states have outlawed DUI roadblocks or checkpoints. So if this was the reason for your stop, check to see if it's permitted in your state., The officer will need a basis for his or her suspicion that you were under the influence. Usually these are facts such as an odor of an alcoholic beverage, slurred speech, and\/or watery or bloodshot eyes. It might help your case if you were able to prove that none of these tell-tale signs existed, or that if they did, there were other, reasonable explanations for them. (Such as using mouthwash or having allergies.), An officer can establish probable cause for the administration of a chemical test, or even an arrest, if you fail the field sobriety tests. It can help your case if you can show that the tests weren\u2019t valid field sobriety tests, or that the results were inaccurate. For example, perhaps you failed the Walk-and-Turn test because of a leg injury., If you can prove that any of the chemical tests were improperly administered, or that the results were compromised, you may be able to exclude the results from a trial.The primary basis for challenging chemical tests (i.e., blood or breath tests) relates to what is called the \"blood alcohol curve.\" The blood alcohol curve helps determine what your blood alcohol content is at any given time.To challenge a chemical test, you will generally argue that because of the science behind this curve, your blood alcohol content was lower at the time of the arrest than at the time of your test. You would argue that, at the time of your arrest, your blood alcohol content was below the legal limit but rose above the legal limit while you were being arrested and processed. For more information about the blood alcohol curve look here.\n\n, If you have been arrested for DUI and you are going to trial, you might want to consider hiring an attorney or having an attorney appointed for you. A criminal defense attorney can help you challenge your stop and arrest and will help you craft and make logical legal arguments at trial.\n\n\nIf you can afford a criminal defense attorney, hire one who concentrates on DUI defense. There are plenty of DUI attorneys out there so look for one with excellent communication skills, a good record of success, and great ethics. In general, a DUI defense at this stage will cost between $5,000 and $10,000. Lawyers are usually paid on an hourly basis so your costs may be more or less depending on how much work needs to be done. For more information on hiring a criminal defense attorney, look here.\nIf you can't afford an attorney but you still want one, the law requires that you be appointed a public defender. If you have not had a court appearance yet, invoke your right to counsel by telling any law enforcement official that you would like an attorney and that you cannot afford one. If you have already had a court appearance, ask the judge to have an attorney appointed for you.\n\n, If you\u2019ve retained a lawyer, he or she will guide you as to what to expect, and how you should act. If you\u2019re representing yourself, consider going to the courtroom where your trial will be held\u2014before your actual trial date. Go inside when a trial is in progress, and pay attention to how the participants conduct themselves. Even though you may not be a lawyer, and even though a judge may give you a little leeway because of this fact, he or she will expect you to obey court rules and regulations., Make sure you have all your witnesses available for your trial date. If an important witness won\u2019t be able to make it, ask the court if you can postpone your case. If you have a lawyer, he or she will review your testimony and your evidence with you in advance. Whether you\u2019re represented by an attorney or not, have your evidence in order, including all documentation and photos you plan to use. You don\u2019t want your case to fall apart because you left a crucial piece of evidence on the dining room table.\n\n, If the prosecutor in your case is willing, consider a plea agreement. In this situation, you\u2019ll plead guilty to an offense other than DUI. For example, the prosecutor may dismiss the DUI charge if you enter a plea of guilty to reckless driving. The benefit is that you avoid a trial, and you don\u2019t have a DUI on your record. There\u2019s no guarantee, however, that a prosecutor will go along with a plea bargain request., If you don\u2019t have an attorney, introduce your evidence, and make your legal arguments, as professionally as possible. If you\u2019ve retained an attorney, listen to his or her advice at all phases of the trial. Whether with an attorney or without one, always conduct yourself properly. Be courteous to the judge, the prosecutor, and any witnesses. The last thing you want to do is alienate a judge or jury by behaving badly. , If you\u2019ve pleaded guilty to DUI, or were found guilty after a trial, the judge may order you to take certain actions, including participating in alcohol rehabilitation or education programs. This is in addition to the penalties imposed. Following through on these orders is required, and failing to do that could lead to more penalties, including not having your driving privileges reinstated, or even jail., If you have a DUI, at some point down the road you may be able to have that conviction removed (expunged) from your criminal record. Not every state allows a DUI conviction to be expunged, and even if it\u2019s removed from any criminal record, it might still remain on your driving history. It\u2019s probably best to consult an attorney to determine if you\u2019re eligible to have your DUI conviction expunged.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":544}
{"text":" Some aesthetic changes will clash against each other. Even worse, you can run out of space to fit all of the pieces on your car. Run all of the ideas past a car expert before making any financial commitments to them.;\n, If all you're looking for is a better look, you might find a paint job does everything you want it to. Cars can be painted with specialized spray paint in your garage. Due to the value of your vehicle, it's very important to be slow and consistent with your paint.\n\n\nIf you're painting the car from home, don't forget to give your car a primer coat beforehand.Car modification garages can offer more intense paint jobs with graphics like flames. These are very stylized, but make sure your car model is worthy of the flair before you commit to something so flashy. Graphic flames on a Toyota Camry won't get you the sort of attention you're looking for.\n\n, Tinted windows add fast class to a vehicle. The mystery factor and privacy of tinted windows can make even an average car look posh by comparison.\n\n\nBy replacing factory parts, you may void your vehicle's warranty. Check with the manufacturer before proceeding.\n\n, Changing them for a snazzier design is relatively inexpensive by car mod standards. The subtle difference it makes to your vehicle's appearance won't go unnoticed by those who know where to look.\n\n\nMake sure your taillight modifications are road-friendly. Although you can change your car's look by replacing the lights on it, you still want to make sure they comply with road regulations.\n\n, While a lot of car modification focuses on the outside presentation, you can revamp your experience on the vehicle by changing the seating. Most stock car seating is cloth-upholstered. For a fashionable touch, replacing this with leather seats is very luxurious.\n\n\nIf you go with leather seating, make sure you take care to maintain it as leather demands.\n\n, This is because car modders tend to have preferences for certain models over others, and more popular models will have a greater number of readymade options. Even a broken down beater can be souped up into something special if you have the money for it. If it's your first time pimping out a car however, you can make it easier on yourself by picking a mod-friendly vehicle to start with.\n\n\nLook online for some examples of your car model being modded. Some car models will come up with lots of results, while others will draw a blank. The number of results will probably give you an idea whether your car is seen as mod-friendly or not.\n\n, This can be done at a car modification garage. Even a slight drop can have a big effect on the look of your vehicle.\n\n\nOn the other hand, you can boost your suspension up for a more rugged look. This option is popular on trucks and SUVs.\nThere is a safety concern involved in lowering your car's suspension. Although it may look cool, you'll be sacrificing some of your car's handling in the process. Keep this in mind if you are considering lowering suspension. A faster-looking car doesn't necessarily mean a better one.\n\n, Spoilers are meant to give your car the visual impression that it's fast enough to need some aerodynamic support. Of course, for all except the fastest race cars, spoilers are just for show.Even so, many gearheads find the look of a spoiler very appealing on a car. Depending on how common the add-on is to your model, your mechanic specialist may be able to direct you to a spoiler specially suited to the car you want modded.\n\n, A stereo system doesn't change your car's appearance in any significant way, but a new subwoofer will be felt. If you have the money to spend upgrading your car, giving your stereo a facelift will give your vehicle the soundtrack to boot. Best of all, you can be as cheap or expensive as you'd like with reinventing your sound system. A new pair of front speakers might only set you back $50, while a full-blown stereo system can cost you thousands of dollars.\n\n\nBass isn't everything to a stereo system. A rich sound will give you more listening enjoyment than a rig with all its power on the bass end of the spectrum.\nDon't be inconsiderate by blasting your subwoofer in crowded areas.\n\n, Hydraulics are a theatrical twist on your car. With hydraulics, you can boost your car's suspension and make it \"dance\". Hydraulics are a big part of car modder culture, and are preferred on vehicles with low suspension, called low-riders. If you want a playful trick to your car, take it to a garage and get this specialized suspension control installed.\n\n\nHydraulic suspension is pricey, and many outside the car modding community associate it with gang culture.\nIf you're in with a car modding community, you might try joining a car hydraulics \"dance competition\".\n\n, If you are interested in increasing the functionality of your vehicle, getting a higher-quality brand of tire for your vehicle can change your experience of driving it. This is an important trick whether you're a car modding or a \"casual\" car owner.\n\n\nKeep your area's weather in mind when you pick out tires. Some tires are specially designed to function in rain or snow.\nGenerally speaking, the bigger your wheels are, the less responsive they'll be when you're driving.Try to strike a balance between form and function with your tires.\n\n, These computers determine how much fuel is injected into the engine at different RPMs. If you want to get an added boost (and fuel economy) from your car, you can buy an input panel for your ECU and have it installed in your car. Although it's only recommended you change an ECU's default settings if you know what you're doing, you can squeeze some extra power out of your car just by improving the efficiency of parts you already have.\n\n\nBy cutting out fuel at precise times, you can make your car \"backfire\", shooting a burst of flame out the exhaust when you rev it. This is not recommended for street vehicles however, and should only be approached if you know what you're doing.\n\n, Having you exhaust and muffler replaced with something more sleek can help improve the vehicle's efficiency. Some car modders also enjoy playing around with the sound a car makes. Removing a muffler will make your car sound considerably louder. While this might make the car sound faster, it's also inconsiderate to other people using the road.\n\n, However, these erode with time. Replacing them with durable polyurethane may be a largely invisible improvement to your vehicle, but it can do wonders for a vehicle's handling if you've been driving it a while.\n\n, Car modifications can affect your insurance premiums. It's best to look into the ways each modification may affect your insurance before committing to them. Talk to your insurance company if you're unclear., All the same you'll want to keep legality in mind while modding your car to make sure it's not taken away from you once you're on the road.\n\n\nLegality will depend on the specific country you're living in. As a general rule, if your car looks more like it's designed for a racetrack, there's probably something about it that conflicts with regulation.\n\n, At the end of the day, you should make sure you're keeping your car safe and useable. Even if something may look cool, nothing is worth putting your life and others in danger.\n\n, Most tasteful mods will be received positively, while more bombastic changes might be seen as a joke by other street users. Make a point of avoiding inconsiderate mods. Removing your car's muffler vastly increases the noise pollution your car will create, and anything that creates excess smoke should be rightly avoided.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":545}

You start off the game with a hut and the town hall, which will be explained later.;\n, Once you start the game, you are in the Stone age, there are many ages\/eras in the game, from this one to the Bronze age and so on. You now need to open up the building menu by clicking on the hand holding a hammer symbol at the bottom of the screen then click on the hut and place it in the required space.\n\n,, Click on it to see your next quest.\n\n, Click to build the hunter, you can place it anywhere, as long as it is connected to road.\n\n, You need to click on the button with the glass science flasks on it and open up the tech tree. This is where you can research technologies to advance in the game, click on 'stilt houses' and use your forge points to research it. You start with 10 forge points; they gradually replenish over time.\n\n, Then click 'back to city'. Your town hall will now change because you have entered a new age! This will happen every time you do, Ragu's appearance will also change but not every time you enter a new age., Now that you are comfortable in the Bronze age, it is time to build 2 new houses to increase your population. Your population is shown at the top of the screen, with a symbol of 2 people in the bar next to the face that shows happiness. Build the 2 houses anywhere that is connected by road, of course then go on to see your next quest!\n\n, As said earlier, the face at the top of the screen shows this, if it is smiling, it means that your people are happy, build decorations to increase happiness.\n\n\nTo build decorations, open the building menu again and click on the tree in a pot symbol, that is where all the decorations. Build one, decorations don't need road so they can be put anywhere! This will increase your happiness and make your people happy!\n\n, You get 2 spear fighters, military units as a reward from the previous quest and this is when they can be put into good hands! You need to click the button with a compass like symbol on it, this will open up the continent map. This is where you and your troops can go into battle and conquer the world!\n\n, Click on attack and it will appear with the preparations menu, click attack again and it will go into battle!\n\n, Click on the space to move your troop there; there are several terrain types on the battlefield. Different ones give you different boosts for your troops; you can't go over water until later in the game so don't click on a water area.\n\n\nThis is a turn-taking game, once you move your first unit, the opponent will move one of his units. Next, move your unit close to the enemy in order to attack it!\n\n,, Now you are free from the main tutorial but it is not over yet!\n\n, Supply production buildings like the hunter have 6 products you can make them produce, they range from 5 minute production to 1 day production times, click on the 5 minute one to start you off. Your town hall produces coins once every day anyway., Once done, click on 'back to city' and build one, like before it needs to be connected to road. The pottery will be in on the menu where the hunter is. Once it is built, put it into production as well, you don't have to but it is always helpful.\n\n, Continue to do Ragu's quests to advance in the game, later in the game, new faces will appear! They are mostly side quests, you don't need to do these but it is always good to help out your friends!","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":550}
{"text":" By being surrounded by this information all the time, they will gradually begin to remember this information subconsciously, meaning that the facts will be second hand. This will make learning even more new information much easier., There are plastic ones available that will float in the bathtub, allowing that fun sense of learning to go beyond the class room and encourage them to think for themselves - encourage them to play with those.\n\n, Remember, the concept of counting is more important than learning to identify shapes of numeric figures - that will be something that comes after counting has become normal in every day life. The recognition of numeric figures should come in natural, gradual way, through activities. Do not force the information too much, especially if the child is struggling with the information or finding it overwhelming. Allow them time to think and explain things in a clear, concise manner which is simple but not immensely detailed. Mastering the basics is your chief aim here before moving on to further elements.\n\n, This should hopefully provide initiative for the child to demonstrate their counting skills whilst playing and without you necessarily needing to ask them.\n\n, Oh, Hey! Another one; and guess what, that's a total of two!\"\n\nThis will subtly remind them of what they have been learning, again encouraging them to think about it beyond the class room to incorporate it into every day life.\n, That will soon clear up as their vocabulary and mathematical skills develop with age and time.\n\n, 1 can of food and 1 more can equals two cans of food. Right?\n\n, \"Can I get a Yeah!\"\n\nSupport them in all they do, to define a clear sense of right and wrong.\n\nUse technical words like \"equals, sum, total, solution, objects,\" etc. They will get the hang of it when you keep using them from day to day. Tell them abstract concept of measurement, like taller than, shorter than, lower than, higher than, smaller than, larger than through these activities. If you feel they are beginning to become used to or accustomed to a word, begin to throw in new words to their vocabulary to make things more interesting and challenging.\n\n, \"Let's 'subtract.' What is 3 bottles of milk 'minus' 1 bottle?\" (That equals two bottles) \"Right!\"\n\n, Explain that when they spend their money then that is \"subtracting\" from what they handed to the cashier, and the answer or \"solution\" is what they get back as change...\n\n, That would be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Doing that motivates a new idea and leads to learning to multiply.\n\n\nRepeatedly adding 2 is what multiplying by two is based upon. It's a short cut for repeated addition of the same number:\n\n2, 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 2 = 6, 6 + 2 = 8, 8 + 2 = 10, two is in 10 5 times. So then say, \"2 multiplied by 5 is equal to 10,\" then also say \"5 times 2 equals 10\"...\n\n\nRepeatedly subtracting 2 is what dividing by two is based upon.\n\n10 - 2 = 8, 8 - 2 = 6, 6 - 2 = 4, 4 - 2 = 2, 2-2 = 0, two is in 10 5 times. So then 10 divided by 2 is 5. Use multiplying to check division.\n10 divided by 5 = 2\n\n\"Check\": 2 times 5 is 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n, at a glance over time.;\n,, Talk about 1\/2 of a candy, half of a drink, etc.\n\n\nAsk, \"Is this half?\" Explain that it's only half if it is split into 2 equal parts, numbers or amounts.\nAsk, \"Can I have the big half?\"; then ask \"Why that is a silly question?\"\n\nExplain that \"half\" really means splitting something into parts that are \"exactly the same\" and so either half should be equal: the same...\n\n\n\n, So explain that 1 out of 2 possible or 2 out of 4 of the same kind of things is another way to say \"one half\", so 2 is half of 4 (of of the 4 items or half of the 4 minutes of \"time\").\n\n\nAvoid gambling when flipping coins or playing dominoes: you don't want to promote bad habits or addiction. They learn about that soon enough.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":551}

{"text":" The easiest way to do this is to type internet speed into Google and then click the RUN SPEED TEST button near the top of the search results. This will give you an estimate of your computer's current download speed.\n\nIf you see that your download speed is significantly faster than files are actually downloading, the problem most likely isn't with your Internet.\nIf your download speed is much slower than your Internet package and router allow for, you need to minimize the number of devices connected to the Internet.;\n, The more devices you have on your network, the slower your Internet will be. If you can disable consoles, phones, televisions, tablets, and alternate computers, your own computer's downloads will be faster., When you're downloading a big (or a small) file, it helps to turn off apps that are taking up your bandwidth.\n\n\nFor example, you'd close BitTorrent if it was running in the background while you attempted to download a Windows update.\n\n, Netflix, Hulu, and even YouTube can be a serious drain on your download speed. Even if it's only by a marginal amount, disabling these services will boost your download speeds.\n\nYou should also close any non-essential browser windows or tabs.\n\n, If your computer isn't using an Ethernet connection, connect it to your router with an Ethernet cable and see if your downloads increase in speed.\n\nIf your downloads do increase in speed, your wireless connection to the router is poor. Try staying closer to the router or purchasing a stronger router.\nIf the download speed doesn't increase, the problem is either with the router or your computer.\nYou can reset your router's cache by unplugging both the router and the modem, waiting for a minute or so, and then plugging everything back in.\n\n, As noble as it may be to give back to your favorite torrenting community by uploading, doing so while downloading will all but kill your download speeds. Wait to seed until all of your downloads have completed and you're no longer using the Internet (e.g., when you're at work or asleep)., This action disguises what you're downloading so that your ISP doesn't selectively throttle it.

Many ISPs have a \"Gamer\" package that prioritizes download speed, though you'll likely have to pay significantly more for this package than you would for a standard Internet package., If you've tried everything else and you can't get your download speeds to increase, you'll need to call your ISP and tell them about the problems you're experiencing.\n\nYou may even need to switch your ISP if you live in a remote-enough area.\n\n, Click the Windows logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen, or press \u229e Win., It's in the bottom-left side of the Start window., It's near the top of the Settings page., This option is beneath the \"Change your network settings\" heading on the Status tab., It will be on the Connections page.

{"text":" Make sure you're not putting yourself in harm's way by administering CPR to someone unconscious. Is there a fire? Is the person lying on a roadway? Do whatever is necessary to move yourself and the other person to safety.\n\n\nIf there is anything that could endanger you or the victim, see whether there is something you can do to counteract it. Open a window, turn off the stove, or put out the fire, if possible.\nHowever, if there is nothing you can do to counteract the danger, move the victim. The best way to move the victim is by placing a blanket or coat underneath their back and dragging it.;\n, Gently tap his or her shoulder and ask \"Are you OK?\" in a loud, clear voice. If he or she responds agreement \"Yeah\" or such, CPR is not required. Instead, undertake basic first aid and take measures to prevent or treat shock, and assess whether you need to contact emergency services.\n\n\nIf the victim does not respond, continue with the following steps.\n\n, The more people available for this step, the better. However, it can be done alone. Send someone to call for emergency medical services (EMS).\n\n\nTo contact emergency services, call\n\u2022 911 in North America\n\u2022 000 in Australia\n\u2022 112 by cell phone in the EU (including the UK)\n\u2022 999 in the UK and Hong Kong.\n\u2022 102 in India\n\u20221122 in Pakistan\n\u2022 111 in New Zealand\n\u2022123 in Egypt\n\u2022120 in China\nGive the dispatcher your location, and notify him or her that you're going to perform CPR. If you're alone, put your phone on speaker mode so your hands are free to start compressions. If you have someone else with you, have him or her stay on the line while you do CPR on the victim.\n\n, Unless you're a trained medical professional, odds are you'll spend too much valuable time looking for a pulse when you should be doing compressions.\n\n, And, make sure that the airway is not blocked. If the mouth is closed, press with your thumb and forefinger on both cheeks at the back of the teeth to help open the mouth and then look inside. Remove any visible obstacle that is in your reach but never push your fingers too far inside. Put your ear close to the victim's nose and mouth, and listen for slight breathing. Watch for rising and falling of the chest.If the victim is coughing or breathing normally, do not perform CPR.\n\n, Make sure he or she is lying as flat as possible - this is to prevent injury while you're doing chest compressions.Tilt their head back by using your palm against their forehead and a push against their chin.\n\n,,, Don't flex the arms to push, but nearly lock your elbows, and use your upper body strength to push.\n\n, Press down with both hands directly over the breastbone to perform a compression, which helps the heart beat. Chest compressions are more critical for correcting abnormal heart rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, heart rapidly quivering instead of beating).\n\n\nYou should press down by about 2 inches (5 cm).\nDo the compressions in a relatively fast rhythm. Some agencies recommend doing compressions to the beat of the chorus of \"Stayin' Alive,\" a 1970s disco hit, or at roughly 100 beats per minute.\n\n,, Place your hand on the victim's forehead and two fingers on their chin and tilt the head back to open the airway.\n\n\nIf you suspect a neck injury, pull the jaw forward rather than lifting the chin. If jaw thrust fails to open the airway, do a careful head tilt and chin lift.\nIf there are no signs of life, place a breathing barrier (if available) over the victim's mouth.\n\n, The American Heart Association no longer considers rescue breaths necessary for CPR, as the chest compressions are more important. If you are trained in CPR and totally confident, give two rescue breaths after your 30 chest compressions. If you've never done CPR before, or you're trained but rusty, stick with only chest compressions.Keeping the airway open, take the fingers that were on the forehead and pinch the victim's nose closed. Make a seal with your mouth over the victim's mouth and breathe out for about one second. Make sure you breathe slowly, as this will make sure the air goes in the lungs and not the stomach.\nIf the breath goes in, you should see the chest slightly rise and also feel it go in. Give a second rescue breath.\nIf the breath does not go in, re-position the head and try again. If it does not go in again, the victim may be choking. Do abdominal thrusts (the Heimlich maneuver) to remove the obstruction.\n\n, If you're also doing rescue breaths, keep doing a cycle of 30 chest compressions, and then 2 rescue breaths; repeat the 30 compressions and 2 more breaths.\n\n\nYou should do CPR for 2 minutes (5 cycles of compressions to breaths) before spend time checking for signs of life.\n\n,, If an AED is available in the immediate area, use it as soon as possible to jump-start the victim's heart. Make sure there are no puddles or standing water in the immediate area.\n\n, It should have voice prompts that tell you what to do.\n\n, Remove any metal necklaces or underwire bras. Check for any body piercings, or evidence that the victim has a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (should be indicated by a medical bracelet) to avoid shocking too close to those spots ().\n\n\nMake sure the chest is absolutely dry and the victim is not in a puddle. Note that, if the person has a lot of chest hair, you may need to shave it, if possible. Some AED kits come with razors for this purpose.\n\n, Follow the instructions on the AED for placement. Move the pads at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from any metal piercings or implanted devices.\n\n\nMake sure no one is touching the person, when you apply the shock.\n\n, If a shock is needed for the patient, the machine will notify you. If you do shock the victim, make sure no one is touching him or her.\n\n, Stick on adhesive electrode pads are intended to be left in place.\n\n,, Then position the free hand onto the opposite shoulder, and roll the victim onto the side with the straight leg. The raised knee\/bent leg is on top and helps stop the body from rolling over onto the abdomen. The arm with the hand tucked under the edge of the hip is kept from sticking out in the way when rolling the patient onto that side.\n\n, This position keeps saliva (spit) from accumulating in the back of the mouth or throat, and helps the tongue to hang to the side without it falling\/flopping into the back of the mouth and obstructing the airway.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":556}
{"text":" Place it on a table or counter so the refrigerator is completely emptied out. You will want to have empty space so that you can easily assess what items to sort through.\n\n\nAlthough most food will be fine when left out for a short period of time, make sure that such food is not left out more than an hour or so. Food can reach \"the danger zone\" in a relatively short period of time.\nHaving a cooler can make the process a bit safer for food safety, especially during hot summer months.\nIf you are cleaning out the refrigerator in cold weather, you may be able to put the items outside while you sort at your leisure.;\n, If possible, bag securely to prevent leakage or mold distribution. The yearly or quarterly refrigerator clean often alerts us to items we've completely forgotten about.\n\n\nCheck expiration and \"use by\" dates. These are indicators that a given item should be cleaned out.\nThrow away items that you are unlikely to use. If no one in the house likes olives, get rid of the jar that has been in the refrigerator since the martini party.\nEmpty the bin afterwards to make sure your house doesn't smell of all the food you throw out!\n\n, In order to get the job done quicker, you'll probably want to remove shelving and the like and place it near the kitchen sink, where it will be much easier to clean.\n\n\nFor a quick clean, you do not necessarily have to take out all shelving. But doing so assures a more in-depth clean.\nUsually shelving comes out in a similar fashion to oven racks, or drawers in a bureau.\n\n, Dish soap will be fine. Most of what you took out of your fridge either won't fit or shouldn't be placed in a dishwasher. Instead, lather up some suds, get a nice brush or sponge to scrub with, and start going at the removable items from your fridge.\n\n\nNever wash a cold glass shelf with hot water. The sudden temperature change could shatter the glass. Instead, use cold water or remove the shelf and let it come up to room temperature before washing it.\nFor heavy-duty spills and\/or stains, don't be afraid to use the power of hot water and ammonia. Dilute a little bit of ammonia in hot water (1:5 ratio should be plenty) and let the item(s) soak before scrubbing.\nBe sure to let the shelving, and drawers dry out completely on a drying rack before inserting back into the refrigerator.\n\n, Attack any big or stubborn stains and hit all the remaining surfaces with a clean cloth or sponge.\n\n\nYou probably don't want to use a strongly scented soap or cleaner on the inside of the fridge, as food may absorb the smell. Instead, use one of the following natural cleaning solutions:\n\n2 tablespoons of baking soda and 1 quart hot water1 part apple cider vinegar to 3 parts hot water\n\n\nFor really stubborn stains or buildups, try using a dab of white toothpaste. It serves as an abrasive cleanser and it smells mighty fine to boot., If your refrigerator door has shelving space and is regularly used, make sure to hit that area too, either with a chemical cleaner or a gentler one (explanation above).\n\n, With a clean cloth, wipe off any excess water from your removable shelving and place it back in the refrigerator.\n\n, Don\u2019t saturate the seal with undiluted bleach as this may ruin the integrity of the gasket. Pat the gasket dry and then apply lemon oil, mineral oil, or body lotion on the gasket to keep the rubber supple.\n\n, Wipe off any jars, bottles, or tupperware and place them back into the refrigerator. Double-check the expiration dates on any perishable items before placing them back.\n\n,\n\n\nPull the refrigerator forward to expose all sides. To avoid scratching your wood floor or tearing linoleum, use an appliance glide when moving your refrigerator.\nClean the all exterior surfaces using a towel and all-purpose cleaner.\nIf your model has the coils mounted on the back of the unit, skip wiping the back until Part 3.\n\n, For information on your refrigerator's condenser coil location, reference your Use and Care manual. Depending on your refrigerator model, the condenser coils can be located in several places:\n\n\nAlong the back of the unit, or\nMounted under the unit and accessed via the rear panel, or\nIn the front of the unit and accessed via the toe grill.\n\n, It is important to unplug the refrigerator to prevent electric shock. If your unit is built-in or difficult to pull forward, turn off\u00a0power via your home\u2019s breaker box.\n\n, Be extremely careful not to puncture the coils.\n\n\nAfter cleaning the coils with a coil brush, use a vacuum with attached brush to clean up the excess dust and dirt on and around the coils. Do not use a cleaning solution on the coils\n\n, The fan circulates are across the coils, which aids in releasing excess heat. If the fan blade is obstructed in anyway, the coils will have a hard time releasing heat.\n\n,,,, Every three months, remove most or all of your food from the fridge and wipe all the surfaces with a baking soda or vinegar solution. Regular maintenance will save you time and energy in the future.\n\n\nThis almost goes without saying, but if you notice a spill or stain in the fridge, try to clean it up quickly and remove the source of the stain. Spills or stains that aren't cleaned quickly can set and become harder to remove in the future.\n\n, Before food goes bad, and starts coating the inside of your fridge with regular blasts of bad odors, it's time to act. Here's what you can equip your fridge with to combat these smells:\n\n\nA clean sock filled with activated charcoal \u2014 from an aquarium store, not from your bbq briquettes. The charcoal absorbs bad odors for up to three months.\nAn opened box of baking soda. Baking soda is another excellent odor absorber.Most baking soda packages say you should change your baking soda out every 30 days, but you can probably get away with 60 to 90 days of use before exchanging.\nFreshly ground coffee, placed in a small dish at the back of the fridge, also works very well at absorbing odors.\nUnscented chlorophyll cat litter is yet another odor buster. 1\/2\" kitty litter in a shallow pan at the back of the refrigerator should eliminate most offending smells.\n\n, This may not be for everyone, but some people might enjoy the subtle hint of vanilla, for example, when they open their refrigerator. The operating word in this whole step is \"subtle.\" You probably don't want any fragrance to be overwhelming upon opening of the fridge. Like cologne or perfume, a nice \"afterthought\" is much more pleasant, especially coupled with food:\n\n\nSprinkle a little vanilla extract, tea tree oil, or essence of lavender, lemon, or even bergamot in a cotton ball and place the cotton ball in a small dish at the back of the fridge. Exchange every couple of weeks.\n\n, A crumpled paper bag works wonders at removing smells in the crisper.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":557}
{"text":" Conures are active birds that like to keep busy.Your conure will need a cage that gives him lots of space to move around and play with his toys.If you have a small conure, his cage should be at least 18 x 18 x 18 inches (46 x 46 x 46 centimeters).A larger conure would need a cage that is at least 36 x 36 x 36 inches (91 x 91 x 91 centimeters). The cage can be either horizontal or vertical.The cage bars should be horizontal so your conure can climb on them.The bars should be spaced no further than 3\/4 inches to one inch (two to 2.5 cm) apart.\nConsider purchasing a cage cover to give your conure a sense of security when he sleeps.Alternatively, you could use a blanket or large towel to cover his cage at night.;\n, Your conure\u2019s cage should be in a room that is not in the direct path of harmful kitchen fumes.Within the room, make sure not to place the cage in direct sunlight.Conures are most comfortable in rooms that are 70 to 80 \u00b0F (21 to 27 \u00b0C), which is the typical room temperature for most homes.\n\n\nThe room should also be free of drafts.Many types of fumes are toxic to conures, including perfumes, aerosols, and fumes from cleaning products and non-stick cookware.\n\n, Perches are an essential item in any bird\u2019s cage. For your conure, choose at least two perches that are 1\/2 to 5\/8 inches (about 1.5 centimeters) in diameter.\n\n\nPosition the perches such that your conure\u2019s tail feathers will not rub against the cage bars when she sits on the perches.Place one perch close to your conure's food and water dishes.Consider using perches that have various sizes, shapes, and textures. This will help keep your conure's feet healthy and strong.Many types of perches are available at your local pet store.\nPlace two to three food and water dishes in her cage. One dish would be for water and one or two would be for food.\nConures love to take baths. Place another water dish in your conure's cage,preferably one that is large enough for her to step in. Look for these dishes at your local pet store or housewares store.\nLine the bottom of your conure\u2019s cage with newspaper or paper liners., Conures can be messy, so you will need to maintain a regular cleaning schedule for your conure\u2019s cage. On a daily basis, you should clean his water and food dishes.Conures like to dip their food in their food bowls, so you may need to clean your conure\u2019s water dish several times a day.Replace the cage lining each day.Clean your conure\u2019s toys and perches on a daily basis. Dishwater detergent is sufficient for cleaning these accessories. Make sure to completely rinse off the soap before placing the cleaned items back in your conure's cage.Depending on how messy your conure is, you will need to disinfect his cage either weekly or monthly.Since bleach fumes can be toxic to your conure, you will need to keep him in a separate room when you disinfect his cage and allow it to dry.Speak with an avian veterinarian or avian expert about safe cleaning products to use in your conure\u2019s cage.\n\n, Conures like to be kept busy. Without things to do, your conure could become bored and resort to feather picking.Giving your conure a variety of toys will keep her happily entertained. Popular toy types for conures include foraging toys, wooden chew toys, and shredding toys.Foraging toys mimic your conure\u2019s natural food foraging behavior in the wild.Shredded toys can help your conure relieve stress and boredom.If you don\u2019t want to purchase a shredded toy, you can place some newspaper in the cage for him or her to shred.\nAvoid toys that have small parts. These parts could catch on your conure\u2019s beak or claws, possibly leading to damage or injury.Keep different types of toys at your conure\u2019s cage at all times to prevent boredom with any one toy.\nConsider installing a play stand in your conure\u2019s cage that can hold toys.All types of toys can be found at your local pet store.\n\n, Conures need lots of exercise to stay happy and healthy. Swings, and ladders would provide your conure with plenty of exercise during the day.For the ladders and swings, install them at heights inside the cage that will keep your conure\u2019s tail from rubbing up against the cage bars.\n\n, Mirrors can be a good choice of enrichment to keep your conure busy. However, introduce him to a mirror only after he has bonded with you\u2014otherwise he may bond with the mirror instead of you!Mirrors can also encourage mating behavior (e.g., regurgitating food, tail lifting).Mating behavior can be especially problematic in female birds, since they can lay eggs without a mate. If you have a female conure, mating behavior can lead to spontaneous egg laying that could result in physical stress and illness.Your conure could see the mirror as a \"love toy.\"Speak with your veterinarian if you are unsure about placing shiny objects in your conure\u2019s cage.\n\n, Pelleted bird food is commercially available at your local pet store. Pellets should make up approximately 60 to 70% of your conure\u2019s diet and seeds no more than 10% and fruits and veggies for the rest. They can come in different colors, which adds a little variety to an otherwise uninteresting food.Pelleted bird food, along with seed mixes, provide a good, nutritious diet.\nSome commercial seed mixes have fillers or harmful additives.Ask an avian veterinarian or the staff at your local pet store if you are unsure about which pelleted food and seed mix would be best for your conure, or select a seed mix that is labeled as \"organic\" or \"all natural.\"\n\n, Variety is key to feeding your conure a nutritionally balanced diet. Fruits and vegetables are a great way to add this variety. Examples of fresh vegetables to feed your conure are collard greens, spinach, pumpkins, and zucchini.There are many types of fruit you can feed your conure, such as mangoes, blueberries, kiwi, and apples.Fruits and vegetables also add important vitamins and minerals to your conure\u2019s diet.Wash the fruits and vegetables thoroughly with water to remove pesticides.Consider purchasing organic produce but not \u00a0avocado because it is poisonous to your bird.Cut the produce into smaller pieces.\n\n, Nuts add healthy protein and fat to your conure\u2019s diet, and should be a mainstay in her daily eating regimen.Examples of nuts to feed your conure are hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, peanuts, and brazil nuts.The nuts should be low in salt.\nAlthough important, nuts should be fed only in small amounts because of their high fat content. Your conure could become obese if she eats a lot of nuts.If you feed your conure peanuts, they must be unshelled. Peanut shells contain a fungal toxin called aflatoxin that could make your conure very sick., In addition to nuts, grains and legumes are mainstays of a conure diet. There are many types of healthy grains you can feed your conure, such as cooked brown rice or barley, as well as cereal, pasta, and crackers.Conures cannot break down sugar very well, so avoid sugary cereals.\nExamples of legumes are lentils and different types of beans (e.g., green beans, black beans).Legumes and grains have vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are essential components of your conure\u2019s diet., You may need to supplement your conure\u2019s diet with certain nutrients, including calcium and vitamin K. Incorporate foods into his diet (dark leafy greens, soy oil, and fish meal) that are high in these nutrients.Adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin K are important to prevent a condition called Conure Bleeding Syndrome.Calcium perches are available that your conure can chew on to get extra calcium in his diet.Cuttlebone is another calcium source, but is not recommended for conures.Water-soluble vitamins can be added to your conure\u2019s water.\nSpeak with your veterinarian before supplementing your conure\u2019s diet.\n\n, Conures are not picky eaters.However, there are certain foods that she should not eat. For example, your conure should not eat avocados, cocoa, or onions.These foods contain toxins that could sicken your conure.\n\n\nHuman foods that are high in sugar, salt, or fat should also be avoided, since a conure\u2019s digestive system cannot break them down very well.Processed foods tend to be high in these ingredients.\n\n, Feed your conure once in the morning and once in the evening. At each feeding time, place a variety of fresh foods, cooked foods, and seeds in his food dishes. After about one hour, remove any remaining food.In the morning, give him some pellets after you have removed the other food. He can snack on the pellets throughout the day.Conures are prone to obesity. To prevent him from overeating at mealtime, feed him only as much as he can eat in one sitting.It will probably take some trial and error to determine how much to feed him at mealtime.\nSince conures are messy eaters and like to dip their food in their water, you may have to replace your conure\u2019s water dish at each meal time.\n\n, Since conures are very social and outgoing birds, interacting with your conure is important to his overall care. To have quality interactions with her, you will first need to gain her trust. One way to gain her trust is to talk to her in a smooth and calming voice.Talk to her throughout the day, especially when you are feeding her and cleaning her cage.\nThe more she hears your voice when you are near her, the more comfortable she will be with you.\nAnother way to gain her trust is to approach her cage slowly and calmly. When she sees that you are not a threat, she will be much more at ease when you are nearby.\n\n, In addition to trusting you, your conure will also need to be comfortable with your hand. Begin by gently placing your hand either on or near the outside of his cage.Talk to him while you hold your hand nearby to calm his anxiety.\n\n\nWhen your conure is comfortable with your hand outside his cage, slowly place your hand inside his cage.Hold some treats (e.g., millet spray, dark leafy greens) in your hand and keep your hand still while he approaches and explores your hand.\nIt may a few days or a few weeks before your conure is comfortable with your hand. Just be patient with him.\n\n, When your conure trusts you and is comfortable with you, you can have all types of fun with her. For example, you can teach her to step up. Using your index finger as a perch, gently press your finger against her lower chest (just above her feet) to encourage her to step up onto your finger.Give her a treat and verbal praise when she steps onto your finger.\nWhen she gets good at stepping onto your finger, you can take her out of his cage and practice stepping up in a different room, such as the bathroom.\n\n, Parrots are known for their ability to talk. However, conures are not as good as other parrot species when it comes to talking ability.Try as he might, your conure will probably be able to learn only about five or ten words.\n\n\nYour conure will need to focus all of his attention on you to learn how to talk. Turn off any other noises (television, radio, phone) that may distract him.Choose simple words and phrases, and associate them with a specific object or action.For example, you can say \"Are you hungry?\" when you feed him and \"Goodbye!\" when you leave the room.\nSpeak with enthusiasm to your conure. The more excited you sound, the more excited and motivated he will be to mimic your words.Your conure\u2019s voice will be high pitched., Another way to interact with her is to help her take her morning bath. Use a spray bottle to gently spritz her with a mist of water.If she will let you, gently wrap your conure in a towel after her bath and hold her close to you until she is dry.Conures are very cuddly, so your conure will probably enjoy being so close to you after a good bath.\nWhen she is dry, your conure will preen herself. To preen, she will use her beak to reach back to her oil gland (located at the base of her tail) and spread the oil over her plumage., Believe it or not, conures have rhythm and like to dance!When your conure is excited or is trying to copy your movements, he will sway back and forth. If you like to dance, turn on some music and dance in front of your conure. Watch in amusement as he sways from side to side to match your movement.\n\n, Playing with your conure is a great way to interact with her. A simple game is \"peek a boo.\" Simply wrap her in a towel and say \"peek a boo\" when you uncover her face.Do this any many times as you want\u2014chances are your conure will love to play this with you over and over.\n\n\nPlay fetch with your conure. Toss a soft stuffed toy towards your conure.Be aware that she might not be very good at catching what you toss, but she will have fun anyway. She may even toss the toy back to you.Mimic your conure\u2019s actions and vice versa. For example, when your conure stretches her wings, stretch your arms out in response.Move side to side, and see if your conure will do the same.\nMake a mess with your conure. Conures love to shred things. When you have your conure out of her cage, sit on the floor with her and make a mess by shredding some newspaper. Give her her own newspaper to shred., Conure owners like to teach this popular trick to their birds. With your conure perched on your finger outside of his cage, place him against your chest with his back facing away from you. Gently place your free hand on his back and begin to bend your body forward very slowly.\n\n\nKeep your hand on your conure\u2019s back as you bend forward. Lying back may feel a bit strange to your conure at first, so he will need your hand on his back to feel more secure with this movement.\nWhen he is comfortable lying back on your hand, you can play with him by tickling his tummy.You could also give him small toys that he can play with when lying on his back.When your conure can lie back, you can teach him more advanced tricks like doing back rolls., As important as it is to interact with your conure, you should not pay her attention when she screeches. Conures are prone to making very loud noises.As ear piercing as these screeches can be, do your best to ignore her when makes this noise.\n\n\nIf you go over to her cage when she screeches, she may learn that she can screech to get your attention. To her, your attention is a reward for her behavior.\nInteracting with your conure on a regular basis and giving him plenty of toys to play with may help to temper his screeches.\n\n, Molting happens to a bird when its feathers naturally shed and new ones replace the old ones. Molting is necessary to any bird's (including conures') growth., Molting begins when the conure is around 8 to 10 months of age and continues on every year. The season in which molting occurs depends on the species of the conure., The conure will be more annoyed and won't be too cooperative. The conure will feel itch due to the new feathers growing out. Water could be sprayed on the conure to relieve the itchiness.,, This could be done by gently brushing your hand on the conure's body to help the new feathers to come out. If you have a couple of conures who are molting at the same time, the conures can support each other by preening each other and rubbing their bodies against each other.Preen gently as new feathers could be painful to the conure when touched.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":558}
{"text":" If it's not on the Dock, you can find it in your Applications folder, or search for it in Spotlight.;\n, To make a movie with iMovie, you must first import the video from your camera to your computer. Most cameras make this a fairly painless process using either USB or Firewire cables directly from the camera, or flash memory cards such as Secure Digital (SD) or CompactFlash (CF) connected through a card reader. You can also import movies from the iPhone or the iPad through the normal 30-pin or Lightning connector.\n\n\nConnect the most appropriate cable to your camera. Using the cable that came with your camcorder, connect the small end to the camera, and the larger end to your computer.\nPower on your camera, and set it play out through the cable. This function will have different names depending on the brand and model of camera you are using. It might be PC\nSelect the image definition of your movie. If you are shooting HD video, select that, or select \"Large,\" or \"Full\" in the import window. If it doesn't open automatically, select \"Import from Camera\" from the File menu.\n\n, The Import window will show you all the clips available on your camera. (Every time you stop and start your camera, you're creating a new clip).You can choose to import all the available clips, or click to deselect the clips you don't want to import, then click \"Import Checked.\"\n\n\nIf you're using a tape-based camcorder, you can import everything, or use the on-screen camcorder controls to fast-forward or rewind to locate a particular piece of film you want to import, and use the Play and Stop controls to start and stop the import.\n\n, Make sure you choose a location with a lot of room: video files, especially HD files, can be quite large. You don't want to run out of room before you even get started!\n\n,\n\n\nThe first time you import video from your camera, there won\u2019t be any existing events in your Event Library.\nTo create a new event, type a name for it in the \u201cCreate new Event\u201d field.\nIf you\u2019re importing video that recorded on different days, you can have iMovie create a new Event for each of those days by selecting \u201cSplit days into new Events.\u201d\nTo append the new video to an existing event\u2014video that you imported into iMovie previously\u2014select \u201cAdd to Existing Event\u201d. Edit the new event\u2019s name from the pop-up menu.\n\n, Choose \"Stabilization\" from the \"After import analyze for\" menu. iMovie will analyze your footage, and smooth any shaky cam motion (such as you might remember from a film like \"The Blair Witch Project.\"\n\n\nThe other option in the Analyze menu is to search your footage for people. This will place markers in the footage when iMovie detects the presence of humans.\nBoth stabilization and searching for people can take a long time to complete.\n\n, If you are importing HD video, choose a size for the movie from the \"Optimize video\" popup menu. When all your settings are set, click the OK button and take a break. It will take anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour.\n\n, First, from the File menu, select \"New Project\u2026\" or press Command-N. This will create the basic project framework. With that created, you can add a theme to your movie. iMovie comes pre-loaded with a number of unique and interesting themes that help give your movie a unique, interesting look and feel. There is everything from a scrapbook theme to a Hollywood blockbuster movie. Preview the options, select the one you like\u2014or select \"No Theme\" if you want to roll your own, then click the Create button.\n\n, Before you add content, you have to give that content somewhere to go.\n\n\nNext to the Themes list, assign a name of your project in the \"Name:\" field.\nChoose an aspect ratio for your movie. The aspect ratio is a dimension describing the height and width ratios. For example, iPads and iPhones before the iPhone 5, standard TV screens, and older computer monitors have a 4:3 aspect ratio. Newer televisions and monitors will use the widescreen 16:9 format.\nChoose a frame rate for your video. Use the same rate the video was shot using. Most video cameras in the U.S. use \"30 fps - NTSC,\" whereas European cameras generally use \"25 fps - PAL.\" If your camera supports 24 fps, and you elected to shoot with that format, then choose that option.\n\n, When you join two clips together, you have several ways of moving between them. You can set up iMovie to always chose a particular transition, though you may switch any preset transition at any time.\n\n\nThe Project Themes automatically add cross dissolves (gradual crossfades between one clip and the next) and other transitions, but allow you to deselect that option if desired.\n\n, When you're done setting up your project, click the \"Create\" button, and the new blank project will open in the Project Browser window.\n\n, Once you've defined a new project, you can add video clips into the movie. All the clips you imported will be listed in the Event Library section below your Project Library and Preview screen.\n\n\nIf you closed iMovie before beginning this section, launch iMovie, then double click on the Project Name of the project you created earlier.\nIf you want to change projects, click on the Project Library button, and choose one from the list.\n\n, In the Event library, all events available will be listed. Select the event you wish to work with by clicking once on it.\n\n\nIf you don't see the event list, look in the lower left hand corner of the iMovie window.\n\n, Select clip or a range of video frames from the film strips in the Event Library.\n\n\nTo select an entire clip, hold down the Shift key, then click once on the clip once, so that it\u2019s outlined in yellow.\nTo select a specific range or section of a clip, click and hold on a section of the clip, then drag across the clip while holding down the button on your mouse or trackpad. Selected frames are outlined in yellow.\nDrag your video selection to the Project browser in the top left of the screen. A vertical green line, along with a green Add (+) symbol, appears anywhere you can place the clip.\n\n, Drag in each clip, or section of a clip, into the Project browser in any order you prefer. You can place the clips sequentially, or place a clip between two others.\n\n, You can add more than movies to iMovie, and add a documentary feel to your film by adding still photographs. Whether scanned or shot digitally, the process is the same.\n\n, Click on the camera icon located on the lower right side of the screen, above the video clips. The Photo Browser will slide in from the right, and lets you choose all the files in your iPhoto library.\n\n\nIf you haven't imported you're stills into iPhoto, you can do so, then click on the Last Import button to see only those images. Otherwise, you can simply drag them in from wherever they are located on your hard drive\u2014though keeping all your images together in one folder is best.\n\n, If you drag it before or after a clip, there will be a green vertical line, indicating that it's safe to place the image in that spot.\n\n\nIf the line is red, you are placing the image in the middle of an existing clip, and you'll be asked if you wish to replace the existing clip, insert the clip, or cancel the operation.\n\n, You can intersperse still images in between a clip of an action scene\u2014for example, grabbing a clip of a snowboarder catching air, extracting a single frame in mid-jump, and then placing that in the video where it was cut from.\n\n\nYou can set the duration of the still, so the end result will be something like: jump begins, boarder starts to lose balance, freeze! The clip lingers on the boarder, giving your audience a moment to realize what's about to happen, then unfreeze! The jump completes, and the boarder does a yard sale\u2014exactly as expected. You could top it off with another still of the the boarder smiling with a face full of snow!\n\n, Once you have everything in place, you can add elements to your film to really make it look special. You can use (or change) themes, add transitions, music, and titles.\n\n, If you didn't choose a theme at the beginning, you can add one now. From the File menu, choose \"Project Theme\u2026\" or press Shift-Command-J.\n\n, Fine one of the thumbnails that you like (you can preview them by clicking them), and choose whether or not to include the automatic transitions.\n\n\nWhen you select a theme, you will see a 30-second sample video so you know what to expect.\nIf you're new to iMovie, use the automatic transitions and titles option. It will help you get a feel for how they work, and you can always change or edit them later.\nMake your choice by selecting or un-selecting the \"Automatically add transitions and titles\" checkbox.\n\n,, You can add transitions between clips by opening the Transitions browser on the iMovie toolbar.\n\n\nSelect the desired transition, then drag it between two clips. iMovie will automatically manage the transition. You can easily change transitions by double clicking on the transition icon in your movie, and selecting a new one from the popup menu.\n\n, A movie without music is what they used to call a \"slide show.\" Nobody liked to sit through those back when that was the only way to see those vacation pics, let alone now, when it's so easy to do.\n\n, This will switch the browser from your photo library to your iTunes library, as well as your Garage Band folder and Sound Effects folders.\n\n\nLook through your list of music until you find the song you want to add. When you find an appropriate selection, click on the song, and drag it to the end of the video clips in the Project browser. Don't drag it over a particular clip. When you see the green vertical line, release the mouse, and your clip will be placed into the movie.\nThe background behind the movie clips will be shaded green for the duration of the music clip, beginning at the first clip in your movie, and ending at the end of the music. Note that this may end before your video track, or go beyond your video track. If the music is too short, you can always add another clip at the end of the project. If it's too long, you can fade it out at the end.\n\n, In the Music and Sound Effects browser, there is a sound effects folder. Click on that, and select a sound effect for a spot in the movie. For example, if you have a clip of people walking, you can add footsteps to the movie, even if you have background music! Drag the sound effect to the first frame you want it to appear. If it's too short, add another sound effect, or if too long, trim and fade out as desired. (See following).\n\n, If the music or effects are too long, too loud, or you want to add some studio effects, click the Action pop-up menu (the gear icon at the top left of the green audio clip), and then click on Audio Adjustments. Play your movie. As long as the Inspector window is open, your movie will loop through the selected sound\u2014making it easy to adjust the settings for short snippets of audio like sound effects, so they're not too loud, or too soft.\n\n\nIn the resulting Inspector window, you can adjust the volume, fade in or fade out, EQ, and other adjustments as desired.\nVolume: adjusts the volume of the selected audio track.\nDucking: drops the volume of all other audio tracks. This is useful if you have a clip of somebody talking over background music. Ducking makes the volume of the background music lower, so the voice can be heard more clearly.\nFade In\/Fade Out: lets you ease in or out of a sound by a specified duration. Click on which one you want to alter, then drag the sliders to the set the length of time for each.\nReduce Background Noise: reduces \"noisy\" sounds, useful for traffic, crowds, etc., to make voices more intelligible. Too much can eliminate background sounds completely.\nEQ: this is just like the EQ on your stereo, and adjusts the tonal qualities of the sound.\nNormalize Clip Volume: this will make the loudest sound in the clip as loud as possible without distortion, making every other sound in the clip louder as well (unless the loudest sound is already at maximum, in which case this will have no noticeable impact on the sound. You can remove added normalization by clicking the \"Remove Normalization\" button below it.\n\n, At the top of the audio Inspector window, click the Clip button, and then the \"Audio Effect:\" popup menu.\n\n\nAudition the reverbs, echoes, and pitch effects by rolling over them (not clicking), and if any are desirable, click on them.\nWhen you're satisfied with all adjustments, click Done, and your choices will be saved.\n\n, You can add text anywhere within the movie, and at the beginning or end as credits.\n\n, A series of different text treatments appear. To add those to your movie, click and drag one to the relevant clip.\n\n, Replace the temporary text with words of your own, as necessary. To alter the font, right click on the text and select \"Show Fonts\" from the menu. Choose from the available list or click \"System Font Panel\" at the bottom left of the window, and choose from your available fonts. There are 9 different color options in the basic panel, but you can set any desired color in the System font panel.\n\n, Select the title clip in the Project browser, and adjust the length as desired by clicking on the side, and dragging in necessary direction.\n\n\nTo view the Title inspector, double click on the title clip.\n\n, If you didn't use a stock theme, you can add credits at the end by dragging the Scrolling Credits title to the end of the movie, and filling in the correct credits.\n\n, iTunes will build your project, with all transitions, effects, titles, and settings baked in. Depending on the length and complexity of your movie, this could take an hour or two, so be ready to take a break!\n\n\nWhen you're done, your movie will be ready to play, burn to DVD, or upload to YouTube. Congratulations!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":559}
{"text":" \u00a0If in doubt, install a clean copy of the OS on a new partition of your computer or on a bootable USB.\u00a0This isn't a mandatory step, but if you want to be truly secure it's a good idea.\n, As of July 2016, the most popular, open source paper wallet creation site is\u00a0bitaddress.org and these instructions will use that site.\u00a0Verify that you are on the correct bitaddress.org site by checking the https certificates by clicking to the left of your browser URL as seen in the photo.\n\n\nAdvanced users can be even more secure by downloading a copy of BitAddress from GitHub, verifying the software using the PGP signature, and moving it to a fully offline computer via USB key. You can then run the BitAddress code offline by clicking the HTML file.\n\n, You can do this by\u00a0turning off your wifi router and or unplugging your ethernet cable. Killing the web connection reduces odds that your private keys will not be leaked\u00a0over the internet without you knowing it. Bitadress.org was designed to run just fine without an internet connection., \u00a0This random movement generates a random seed that BitAddress will use to generate your wallet.,\u00a0Congrats, you just created a basic, low\u00a0security paper wallet!\n\nOn the left is a your Bitcoin address. In the example in the photo the address is \"15TfQt6RyNrqjJknd3b3CRkbwfXJ3i3BNC\".\u00a0 Think\u00a0of this as your email address. \u00a0It's OK to share it in public so people (or yourself) can send Bitcoin to the address.\nOn the right is your private key. In this example it's \"L4vfUiBm9XGeaXk8HWPkQfiTogQoZC6kzNnyPnqGEoBQaRXoAYkT\" Think of this as the password to your email address. \u00a0Never, ever share your private key with anyone or store it on a computer or the web. \u00a0Anyone who can access your private key can immediately and irretrievably empty your wallet.\nIf you are storing a small amount of Bitcoin and are OK with low security you can print out this wallet and stop now. \u00a0If you need\u00a0higher security continue following the steps in Part 2 of this article.\n\n, Treat it like gold or jewelry. \u00a0If someone finds it and takes it, they can easily empty your wallet. Store a backup copy of the wallet in another secure location.,\n\nIt's also possible to do this with the other options such as Bulk Wallet, but for the sake of simplicity we'll use the Paper\u00a0Wallet example.\n\n, Create\u00a0a long passphrase that you do not use anywhere else. Store\u00a0that passphrase separately from your bitcoin wallet., Congrats you have now created 3 high security paper wallets with encrypted private keys!\n\nUnlike in the example\u00a0Part 1,\u00a0the private key in this wallet is not stored in plain text. You will need to use your passphrase to\u00a0open the wallet. \u00a0This additional layer of security makes your wallet much more secure.\n\n, \u00a0By not using the network to print, you avoid the albeit low risk that your network is compromised and might read your private keys.\n\nPrint multiple copies of your paper wallet. This is a beauty of BIP38 paper wallets, you can have multiple backups, one in a bank safe deposit box, one in a home safe, one with your law firm, or whatever -- when BIP 38 protected all you have to be is trusting enough that the bank or whoever has it won't do a brute force attack.\n\n, \u00a0Close the private window on your browser and verify that no copies were stored in the cache. Close your browser. Reboot your computer. \u00a0Only then can you turn your internet back on., You now have encrypted paper wallets that have never accessed the internet. Read Part 3 below to learn how to safely use these paper wallets.,\u00a0\u00a0If you want you can send a very small amount of bitcoin to one wallet for testing you can do that, or you can practice with an empty wallet. \u00a0Either way works. The following steps will explain the procedure., This example will use Blockchain.info, which is open source, free and the most popular web\u00a0wallet as of June 2016. Go to Blockchain.info and follow their steps to create a wallet., \u00a0On the next screen click \"Import Address\"., Put the\u00a0private key QR code from your paper wallet in front of the webcam till you get the verification checkmark. \u00a0This can take a little futzing to make work. \u00a0It helps to have good lighting and to keep the QR code in focus., If all works out, you will be notified that you have successfully opened your private wallet. \u00a0Congrats! You've successfully decrypted your test wallet!\n\nNow that you have exposed the private key of this paper wallet to the internet, do not use it to store funds. Put this\u00a0wallet away and don't use it again.\nRepeat the above steps with other paper wallets if you think you need practice decrypting. \u00a0Make sure you've figured this step out before placing real funds in the wallet.\nNote that this process is the exact same process you will use to spend or move bitcoins from your paper wallet. The reason we are testing them now is to make sure you can successfully get your coins off your paper wallet when you are ready to do it.\nDo not proceed to later steps until you are confident you can decrypt wallets with your passphrase.\n\n, You do this by\u00a0using your public bitcoin address. \u00a0So say you having your friend send you bitcoin, just email or text her your bitcoin address. \u00a0Or if you bought coins on a bitcoin exchange like Kraken, Circle or Coinbase, log in to your exchange account and send the bitcoin from there to your bitcoin address.\n\nDo not reuse any of the wallets your opened during testing. Use a brand new one.\n\n, You can do this using any of the blockchain watching services. \u00a0Blockchain.info is helpful here. \u00a0Just go to the Blockchain.info homepage and enter your bitcoin address (but not your private key) into the search field. \u00a0You should see exactly how much bitcoin your wallet holds., Your coins are now\u00a0safely locked into your paper wallet. \u00a0As long as you\u00a0don't ever enter your private key to just \"check\" on your wallet, your funds will stay totally safe.\n\nAs long as only you have the ability to access both your private key and passphrase remain your funds will stay safe for years. This security costs you absolutely nothing. No bank fees ever.\n\n, Keep a backup in another location in case the first location is burned down or flooded. Store the BIP38 passphrase in a still separate location. It's okay to leave the passphrase in a computer or password manager program. Access to your BIP38 passphrase without your wallet's private keys can cause you no damage., If you want to spend or move your bitcoins it's important that you don't leave any funds in the paper wallet you spent with. If you do want to spend with your wallet, sweep all the funds into an online wallet like Blockchain.info and use all the funds there. Do not attempt to reuse a paper wallet.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":560}
{"text":" As soon as the noodles have come to a boil, turn off the heat and strain the noodles. Submerge shirataki in a bowl of cool water.\n\n\nThe shirataki shouldn\u2019t need much cooking. Rather, the par-boiling is designed to remove some of the odor from the noodles. Then the shirataki can absorb the full flavor of the sukiyaki sauce.\nIf using other kinds of noodles, look at instructions and par boil until they are only a couple minutes away from being al dente.;\n, Sukiyaki calls for very thin beef. Choose a marbled sirloin (or similar) cut for very good results.\n\n\nPlace the beef in the freezer for a couple of hours if you want to slice the beef yourself. When hard but not completely frozen through, beef is much easier to slice very thin., The stalks of the cabbage are a little more fibrous and take longer to cook. Therefore, cut right around the stalks of the cabbage until the stalks can be separated from the leaves. Cut the stalks into 1-inch (or smaller) pieces. Coarsely chop the leaves into larger pieces.\n\n, If you weren't able to get shiitake mushrooms, cut whatever mushrooms you have into bite-size pieces. If you were able to get the shiitake, here's how to traditionally prepare them:\n\n\nRemove the stem from the shiitake with a knife. Score a small star or cross into the cap of the mushroom with a knife. Imagine a straight line going through the middle of the cap. Take a knife and make a 30\u00b0 angled cut along this straight line, digging only a small amount of flesh from the mushroom, enough to show the whites. Angle the knife in the opposite direction and make another 30\u00b0 cut along the other side of the line. Repeat this process at the perpendicular to make a cross, and once more to make a star.\nFor enoki mushrooms, simply wash and cut off the root bulb to prepare.\n\n,, If substituting spinach or watercress, rinse thoroughly and separate the leaves from the stalks. Discard the stalks.\n\n, In a pot, bring 1\/2 cup sake, 1\/2 cup mirin, 1\/3 cup soy sauce, and 1\/4 cup sugar to a boil over medium heat. As soon as boil is reached, remove the sukiyaki sauce from the heat. The goal is to burn off the alcohol from the sake, not reduce the sauce.\n\n, The traditional way of cooking sukiyaki involves an earthenware or cast iron hot pot with a kerosene burner underneath. This way the chef can cook at the table where he intends to serve. Alternately, an electric pan can be put to great use to cook at the table as well.\n\n\nIf you have neither a hot pot or an electric pan to cook with, you can of course cook the sukiyaki on the burner away from the table. Just make sure to choose a large pot with an accompanying lid.\n\n, Beef suet is traditional, but lard or even vegetable oil can be used if the aim is a healthier meal.\n\n, You will keep the beef in the pot while the other ingredients cook, so be careful not to overcook it. Once the beef loses its pinkness, move it over to the side of the pan so it doesn't cook at quickly.\n\n\nSome cooks introduce a little bit of the sukiyaki sauce to the pan while they are cooking the beef.The sukiyaki sauce will bubble and reduce quickly because of the soy sauce.\nOther cooks prefer sweetening the beef a little with plain sugar while it\u2019s frying in the pan with the fat. There's no reason you can't do both.\n\n, Keep all ingredients separate; each separate ingredient should be bunched together on the pan.\n\n, Since shirataki contains a compound that makes beef tough, segregate it from the beef while all the ingredients are cooking.\n\n, Introduce the cabbage leaves, chrysanthemum, and onions into the remaining spots of the pot.\n\n,,, Traditionally, a dipping sauce of raw eggs is served alongside sukiyaki.The combination may not sound especially appetizing to westerners, but it is a surprisingly good combination, even if you aren\u2019t predisposed to liking it.\n\n\nIf you are worried about uncooked eggs carrying salmonella or don\u2019t like the flavor, omit them. For what it\u2019s worth, salmonella is very rare in raw eggs., Simply grab whatever looks appetizing out of the hot pot and dip it into the egg.\n\n\nIf you are not eating with family or close friends, use the thicker ends of your chopsticks to grab food out communal pots. This is considered polite.\n\n, If there are leftovers that didn\u2019t find into the first generation of the meal, cook them now in the remaining broth. Meat and leafy greens will take less time to cook than vegetables will.\n\n, In Japan, it is traditional to use the leftover broth as the broth for udon noodles. If you don't have enough broth but wish to make more, use the recipe for sukiyaki sauce above and combine it with the remaining sauce. Heat the broth back up to boiling, then reduce the heat to a simmer.

{"text":" You should have at least an undergraduate degree in order to become a private banker. It is helpful (but not necessary) for the degree to have a concentration in a finance area.Good choices include finance, business administration, or economics.Otherwise the degree can be in any area you excel in.\n\n\nMany private bankers supplement their initial education with a master\u2019s degree or even a Ph.D. in finance, business, or economics.\nAn undergraduate degree is not a legal requirement, but may be the requirement of the bank for banking officers generally.;\n, However, any sort of experience in banking, investment, or related areas can be beneficial. If you gain some experience, then you can prove your capability to private banking firms who might hire you in the future. In addition, you may have the chance to network with HNWIs while completing an internship.\n\n\nTalk to professors, a university career center, and anyone you know working in a financial field about the possibility of doing an internship. Many private banking firms and other financial companies already have established internship programs, so you should check with these directly as well.\n\n, These can raise your professional profile and the chances of landing your dream job.\n\n\nThe Wealth Management Institute (WMI) offers the 10-week Wealth Management Private Banking Programme and an associated certificate.This course is comprised of several sessions covering topics such as understanding the needs of business owners, private equity and hedge funds, estate planning, and asset allocation.\nThe Globecon Institute offers a nine-month course and certificate in \u201cPrivate Banking and Wealth Management\u201d as well as a three- to four-month course and certificate in \u201cOperations in Investment Banking and Securities Markets.\u201d\n\n, In the United States, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) administer licenses that private bankers must have in order to collect commissions of the sale of financial products.The Series 6 license permits private bankers to advise clients on \u201cpackaged\u201d products such as mutual funds, annuities, and trusts. The licensed is awarded by passing a 135-minute exam on investing, regulations, and ethics. In order to apply for the license, you must be sponsored by a firm that is a FINRA member.\nThe Series 7 license allows private bankers to advise clients on individual securities such as stocks and bonds. The license is awarded by passing a 6-hour exam on securities trading. In order to apply for the license, you must be sponsored by a firm that is a FINRA member.\nThe NASAA administers the Series 63 license that every state requires private bankers to have in order to advise clients on investments. The license is awarded by passing a 75-minute exam. You must have the Series 63 license before you can apply for the Series 6 or Series 7 license.\nThe NASAA also administers the Series 65 license, which permits private bankers to advise clients for an hourly fee rather than a commission. This license is awarded by passing a 180-minute exam.\n\n, Get to know some of these individuals and their needs very well. If you do not already know potential clients, then you will need to seek some through networking. Much of the networking for private bankers might take place in social or informal settings.\n\n\nStart by working with any HNWIs that you know. Have lunch with them, try to get invited to events they might attend with other HNWIs, etc.\nWhen you meet HNWIs, make sure to get their contact information (including social media profiles), and share yours with them.\nOnce you form initial connections with HNWIs, begin asking them about meetings or informal events like a round of golf. Use these as an opportunity to get to know each other better.\nBe present at any events that HNWIs are likely to attend, such as fundraisers. These are opportunities to meet potential clients, but also to learn about what is important to them.\nBe firm about how you can help HNWIs with private banking services, but don\u2019t be pushy. Show genuine care for their work and interests.\n\n, You can work with these clients on your own, essentially setting up your own business. However, you may be more likely to attract and retain clients if you have the name recognition and security of an existing private banking firm, and so you may want to seek a job at one of these.\n\n\nIf you do have a list of potential or current clients, ask them about whether or not they would be willing to have you continue advising them if you moved to an existing private banking firm. If so, mention this to firms that interview you or that you approach about a job.\n\n, If you create a professional profile and make connections with others in private banking and other financial fields, then you have a better chance of being contacted about jobs that open up.\n\n\nKeep things professional. If you have social media accounts with public or semi-public profiles, make sure there is no content on them that you would not want clients to see.\nA general rule of thumb is if you would not share it with your grandmother, it should not appear on your social media profile.\nFocus on forging worthwhile, meaningful relationships rather than on increasing the sheer numbers of your followers, friends, or connections on social media. If you intend to use your social media accounts for professional purposes, then those relationships should be professional.\nIf you have social media accounts and intend to use them professionally, then it is important to regularly check and update them. If an account has not been updated in awhile, it will look odd, and if you don\u2019t check it regularly, then you might miss out on important communication or potential connections.\n\n, Make sure that yours emphasizes your skills and experience in private banking and\/or other financial fields, so that you increase your chances of landing an interview and your dream job.\n\n\nYou can send out resumes to apply for any posted openings in or related to the private banking field. However, you can also communicate with institutions that aren\u2019t currently hiring. Let them know you are working in or looking to enter the field. Give them a copy of your resume, and ask them to keep it on file in case they hire in the future. Showing initiative like this can be beneficial and make you a memorable job candidate.\n\n, One alternative is to get a start in personal banking, providing services (investing, retirement planning, etc.) to regular individuals. While you wait for a job in private banking to materialize, you will gain useful banking experience.\n\n\nPersonal banking is not a direct or obvious path to enter private banking. While serving in personal banking, you will still need to focus on networking with HNWIs who can potentially become your clients.\nIn addition, you will need to aggressively seek any opportunities to move out of personal banking into private banking. Keep sending out resumes and holding informational interviews, let supervisors at your current institution know that you are looking to enter private banking, and keep offering to work with any HNWIs that you know.\n\n, These are offered to select clients with larger portfolios or net worth (though not as high as HNWIs). Many of the same products and services offered to HNWIs are also offered to privilege banking customers, with the exception of hedge funds and private equity.\n\n\nPrivilege banking can offer more opportunities to meet or network with HNWIs, so actively seek out these individuals while working in the field.\nIn addition, continue to send out resumes and otherwise seek jobs in private banking. Stress how the skills you have developed in privilege banking will make you an effective private banker.\n\n, These help with scheduling, documents, and other demands of private banking. There may also be occasional opportunities to meet with HNW clients, although assistants do not normally advise them on financial matters.\n\n\nIf you are good at your job, your firm may eventually offer you some clients to service, or you may be able to take over the position when one of the firm\u2019s private bankers retires or leaves.\n\n, While this can provide you with knowledge and experience in the financial world, it will not provide the same opportunities to develop relationships with HNWIs. Thus, if you want to enter private banking from another area of finance, you will have to work hard to network with potential clients in addition to performing your regular job duties.\n\n, This means constantly reading financial news and reports, keeping up with the fine details of investments, staying abreast of financial laws and regulations, etc. If you do not keep up with this knowledge, then you risk providing your clients with bad advice and losing them; without your clients, you will not be able to work as a private banker.\n\n, To keep your clients happy (and gain new ones), you must be prepared to work very closely with them.\n\n\nMake sure that your clients can reach you at any time, and in many ways (phone, text, email, etc.).\nBe prepared to work long or odd hours in order to work around your clients\u2019 schedules.\nPrivate bankers will benefit from knowing about their clients\u2019 personal lives, family, businesses, etc. This knowledge can help you provide services and products that are tailored to a client\u2019s specific situation.\nBe able to engage with clients about the world in general\u2014current events, hobbies, politics, etc. HNW clients often want to see that their private bankers are well rounded, knowledgeable, and trustworthy, since that implies that they will provide excellent service.\nDon\u2019t be surprised if your clients ask you to do things that may not seem directly related to financial matters. This may mean they ask you to discuss a deal over a round of golf; it might also mean that they ask you to pick up their pet from doggy daycare so that they will have time for a meeting. Remember that your clients are your number one priority, and be flexible in meeting their requests.\n\n, Private bankers have to offer their clients excellent discretionary portfolio management.This service is \u201cdiscretionary\u201d in the sense that it is up to the portfolio manager (the private banker) to determine how to best maintain and grow a client\u2019s assets. This involves:\n\n\nUnderstanding the whole range of investment products: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), etc.\nHaving an in-depth knowledge of domestic and global markets, business trends, and investment strategies.\nMaking superior buy and sell decisions of investment products, based on the private banker\u2019s analysis of markets and trends.Determining how to allocate a client\u2019s assets among different investment products in order to ensure that the client\u2019s investment or personal goals are met.\nWorking with clients to explain the risks of any investment, and how to recover from any losses.\n\n, Each HNWI has different goals and needs, and your account management strategy will need to take these into account.\n\n\nUnderstand the different components of an individual\u2019s wealth and estate, which may include retirement accounts, insurance packages, annuities, real estate, personal assets (such as homes, vehicles, art or other collections), etc.\nAdvise your clients with both short-term and long-term goals in mind.Clients are interested in finding ways to make their wealth grow (short-term goals), but also think about how to maintain it for retirement, to pass on to descendants, etc. (long-term goals).\nDevelop a flexible strategy for managing your clients\u2019 wealth, since their needs and goals will change over time.For instance, you might advise a client to invest more aggressively when they are younger, in order to take advantage of opportunities for growth; as the client ages, however, you might advise them to stabilize their investments in order to protect them.\n\n, Laws, regulations, and strategies regarding estates and trusts can be complex and very particular, and so a private banker will have to work hard to advise clients well in these areas.\n\n\nPrivate bankers may advise clients on financial aspects of wills and choosing an executor.Since different assets are subject to different regulations and strategies, private bankers assist clients in planning for each asset class. For instance, you may help a client decide to leave real estate as an estate for heirs, while utilizing other investments as a philanthropic gift.\nMany HNWIs plan to create trusts for their dependents, and a private banker will assist in the creation and management of these.Charitable gifts are another common part of estate planning, and private bankers are called upon to help clients select and structure these.Estate and gift taxes can be substantial, and so a major part of a private banker\u2019s job can be helping clients plan to minimize these costs.Estate and trust plans will have to be reviewed and updated regularly, since clients\u2019 needs and circumstances change over time.\n\n, A key performance indicator (KPI) of private bankers is the amount of AUM they have.This refers to the amount of clients\u2019 money and investments that you manage. It is directly related to the fees that you or your firm charges your clients, and thus to your commission and salary. To succeed as a private banker, you will need to keep your AUM high and growing by providing services and products to established and new clients.\n\n\nThe salaries of private bankers working with established firms can vary widely, with estimates ranging from $30,000 to well over $100,000. Much of a private banker\u2019s salary is determined by the value of AUM.\nIn order to succeed in the long run, private bankers must always be thinking about the needs of their current clients as well as attracting new ones.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":564}

{"text":"\n\n\nIf someone says you are a racist person, this suggests a bigger problem. Maybe you've done multiple things that came off as racist. Or maybe they're just having a really awful day.;\n, When someone says they think you're a racist, take them seriously. Make time to listen to their concerns.\n\n\nLet the other party talk first before you respond; do not interrupt the other speaker. Then, in a calm and measured way, say, \u201cWow, I am very concerned that you consider me a racist. I\u2019m interested in discussing this matter further. Let\u2019s do so in the privacy of (my office, a cafe, a quiet room, etc.).\u201d\nIf there is a power imbalance, they may be afraid to speak to you in a completely private place. If so, try a semi-public place, like a restaurant, a park bench, etc.\n\n, Especially if they are a minority, they may be afraid of you, so do your best to put them at ease. This shows them that you are an understanding person who is willing to listen.\n\n\nFor example, \u201cI'm sorry if I've said or done anything hurtful. I'm really concerned about this. I want people of all races to feel safe and relaxed around me, so if I'm making people uncomfortable, I want to hear about it so I can learn from it.\u201d\n\n, Listen closely to what they have to say.It may be that you've made some mistakes, or that you said things that were interpreted differently than you intended.\n\n\nTell them, \u201cI want to know why you think this. What have I done that's racist?\u201d Listen attentively to their response.\n\n, Show sympathy for any racism they've faced, whether it was a misunderstanding or not. Make it clear that you care about their pain. (Some of it might be from other experiences that were not your fault.) This will help them feel calmer, and feel like they can trust you.\n\n\nFor example, \u201cThat must be difficult,\u201d \u201cI'm sorry to hear that you had to deal with that,\u201d and \u201cthat's too bad\u201d are examples of validating statements.\n\n, If you are white and the other person is a person of color, they probably know more about racism than you do. Listen carefully to their explanations; you may be surprised.\n\n\nThey might think you\u2019re racist because you support racist policies such as criminalization of certain drugs or exclusionary zoning policies. While such policies in theory are not aimed specifically at minorities, their implementation and impact are decidedly biased for or against a given race and therefore racist.Expressing support for politicians who pursue strengthening these policies might be perceived as racist.\nFinally, the most obvious and common definition of racism is one in which a person believes one race is superior or inferior to another. Using explicit racial slurs, supporting slavery\/segregation\/deportation, believing race drives behavior (e.g. \"Mexicans are rapists\"), are all examples of serious racism. If you said \u201cI believe it was a mistake to free the slaves,\u201d for instance, you are a racist.\nIf you don't understand, ask. \u201cI don't understand why that's racist. Would you please explain for me?\u201d\n\n, Mentions of your black friend, your Asian boyfriend, your time volunteering with Latinx children, etc. aren't going to fix things.Mentioning your ancestry doesn't help, either; just because you are of a minority race, doesn't mean you can't be racist to those of other minority races. Not all racists are hateful people who burn crosses, and you can be accidentally racist even while disliking racism in general.\n\n, Remind yourself that in the West, where governments and societies have long been controlled and guided by white men, everyone is racist to some degree or another. Recount to your accuser that many examples of unconscious racial bias exist in you, and that you will try to do better.Use the specific circumstances of the conversation or situation which led to you being accused of racism in order to clarify your position on the issue at hand.\n\n, It may have been that you said something that sounded racist, even if that's not how you meant it. If so, apologize for the misunderstanding and any discomfort on their part, and clarify what you truly meant.\n\n\nFor example, \u201cWhat I meant to say is that I disagree with Obama's policies, and dislike what he's done with the country. I am glad that America has had its first black president, and hope there will be many more. I'm sorry if I gave you the impression otherwise. That is definitely not what I meant.\u201d\nAcknowledge any surprise you feel. For example, \u201cOh, no, I'm so sorry! I'm surprised and horrified if my words came out that way! I think your fiancee is charming, including her dark skin! And I'm happy to have her joining the family, I promise, and I will call her and tell her that today.\u201d\n\n,\n\n\nThink about your culture\u2019s history in a framework which acknowledges the structural challenges to a fully egalitarian society. You have most likely absorbed some cultural biases without knowing.\nList some examples to demonstrate you understand the issue. Listening less intently to minorities; showing more caution around people of color; and being less likely to hire someone whose name is not traditional or sounds ethnic are just some of the many unconscious but racially biased behaviors everyone in a white society will likely exhibit., If you unintentionally hurt someone, own up to it and apologize. If they aren't ready to forgive you, ask if and how you can make it up to them. You want the person to walk away feeling satisfied and safe around you.\n\n\nIf someone was insulted, tell them a few things that you admire about them. Explain that you value them as a friend\/colleague\/mother-in-law\/etc., and assure them that the racist remark doesn't reflect your feelings about them.\nFor a friend or loved one, spend some extra time on the relationship. Take them somewhere fun, do something nice for them, or take extra quality time together.\nIf someone doesn't want to see you, give them space for as long as they need. This shows that you respect their wishes.\n\n, If they publicly called you names, ask them if they would rescind it.If you've been empathetic and willing to make amends, they will most likely agree. If they refuse, you can do little about it, but continue to explain yourself and let people know, if necessary, that you and the accuser have buried the hatchet, and you've made amends for any racist actions.\n\n\nAt the end of the conversation with the person who called you a racist, ask gently, \u201cAre you satisfied with how this turned out? Do you still consider me a racist or bad person? If not, would you please let others know? I want to move on from this, and would like to keep my reputation intact if possible.\u201d\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":566}
{"text":" This is useful because conditional formatting is best understood by testing it on data you already have. While you can apply conditional formatting to empty cells, it is easiest to see if the formatting works by using pre-existing data.;\n, Conditional formatting allows you to change font style, underline, and color. Using conditional formatting, you can also apply strike-through as well as borders and shading to the cells. However, you cannot change the font or the font size of the contents in the cell.\n\n, In Excel 2007 this can be found under \"Home\" > \"Styles\" > \"Conditional Formatting\".\n\n, For this example, two conditions are used to see how each one plays off the other. Excel allows up to three conditions per cell. If you need only one condition, skip the next step.\n\n,,, If it is based on other cells, change the first drop-down to \u201cFormula Is.\" For \u201cFormula Is\" directions, go to the next step. For \u201cCell Value Is\" directions, do the following:\n\n\nSelect what kind of argument works best using the second drop-down box. For conditions between a low setting and a high setting, select \u201cbetween\" or \u201cnot between.\" For conditions using a single value, use the other arguments. This example will use a single value using the \u201cgreater than\" argument.\nDetermine what value(s) should be applied to the argument. For this example, we are using the \u201cgreater than\" argument and cell B5 as the value. To select a cell, click the button in the text field. This will minimize the conditional formatting box.\n\n, After selecting \u201cFormula Is,\" all the drop-downs disappear and you are left with a text field. This means you can type in any formula you want using Excel\u2019s formulas. For the most part, you want to stick to simple formulas and avoid text or text strings. Keep in mind that the formula is based on the current cell. For an example, think like this: C5 (current cell) = B5>=B6. This means that C5 will change formatting when B5 is greater than or equal to B6. This example can actually be used in \u201cCell Value Is,\" but you get the idea. To select a cell in the worksheet, click the button in the text field. This will minimize the conditional formatting box.\n\n\nFor example: Imagine you have a spreadsheet with all the days of the current month listed down in Column A; you need to enter data in this worksheet everyday; and you would like the entire row associated with today's date to light up in some way. Try this: (1) Highlight your entire table of data, (2) Select conditional formatting as explained above, (3) Select \"Formula Is\" and (4) Enter something like =$A3=TODAY() where Column A contains your dates and Row 3 is your first row of data (after your headings). Note that you want the dollar sign in front of the A but not in front of the 3. (5) Select your formats. , You will notice that it automatically places dollar signs ($) before the row and column designations. This makes that cell reference non-transferable. This means if you were to apply the same conditional formatting to other cells through copy\/paste, they will all reference the original cell. To turn this off, simply click in the text field and delete the dollar signs. If you do not want to set a condition using a cell in your sheet, simply type the value into the text field. You can even enter text, depending on the arguments. For example, don\u2019t use \u201cgreater than\" as the argument and \u201cJohn Smith\" in the text field. You can\u2019t be greater than John Smith...well, you could, but - oh, never mind. In this example, the whole condition, if you were going to say it out loud, would read something like this: \u201cWhen this cell\u2019s value is greater than the value in cell B5, then...\"\n\n, Keep in mind that you want to offset the cell from the rest of the sheet, especially if you have lots of data. But you also want to make it look professional. For this example, we want the font to become bold and white and the shading to become red. To begin, click \u201cFormat...\"\n\n, Then click \u201cBorder\" and make any changes there. This example does not make border changes. Then click \u201cPatterns\" and make changes there. At whatever point you are finished making the formatting changes, click \"OK.\"\n\n, Make changes as needed until the formatting appears the way you would like.\n\n, You will notice in the example that the second condition also includes a small formula (=B5*.90).

{"text":" Sprint drills are an easy way to accomplish this.\n\n\nRun at top speed for 20-30 meters.\nMake sure that your arm action is smooth and relaxed during the exercise. Keep your arms close to your body.Focus on making smooth, even strides, with your knees high.\nKeep your head relaxed and in a natural position.\nSlow jog or walk back to your starting point when finished with the sprint.\nDo 2-4 repetitions of this drill.;\n, Acceleration drills will make you build up to and come down from high speeds more efficiently. This type of exercise also helps you work high speeds into other routines. To do a simple acceleration drill:\n\n\nJog for 10 yards.\nSprint for 10 yards.\nShift back to jogging for 10 more yards.\nShift back to sprinting for 10 more yards.\nBreakdown in 5 yards.\nWalk back to your starting point.\n\n, This horizontal tool requires you to alternate your feet across successive rungs as you run. To improve your speed, train with the ladder while using a stopwatch, and work on improving your best time.\n\n\nSpeed ladders are available at many athletic supply stores.\n\n, To accomplish this, do 30 minutes of interval training. Alternate light jogging (5-10 min) with short bursts of more powerful exercises, such as:\n\n\nSprints\nRunning stairs or hills\nLadder drills\nUsing a ball in combination with any of the above\n\n, To improve your reaction speed, practice while a coach or friend calls (or better, uses a visual signal) for you to change your exercise. Respond as quickly as possible. Try incorporating a combination of exercises like:\n\n\nChanging direction rapidly when running\nSprinting on command\nPlaying \u201cRed Light Green Light\u201d\n\n\n, To accelerate, you will have to extend and use your hip, knees, and ankles.When running or doing other exercises, focus on making long, even strides that stretch out. Increasing your stride length and muscle output in this way will boost your speed.\n\n, While training to increase your speed at moving across the field, do not neglect your control of the ball. Remember that soccer is primarily a sport where the player\u2019s lower body moves in contact with the ground and ball. To be not only fast, but fast and in control of the ball, you must work on your agility.\n\n\nDribble at every opportunity, using all parts of your foot (outside, inside, top, and bottom).Do speed dribbling exercises by kicking the ball slightly forward and running after it.\nPractice changing direction quickly while dribbling and doing speed dribbling exercises. You can also do this while attempting to evade another player in order to practice using quick dribbles as a way to beat opponents.\nDo lateral ball drop exercises. Have a coach or partner hold a ball at shoulder height, 5 meters away from you. When your coach\/partner drops the ball, attempt to reach and control the ball before it bounces a second time.\n\n, Always do stretches and short exercises to warm up before beginning a speed training session.This will prepare your mind and body. If you do not properly warm up, you risk injuring yourself.\n\n, Since it utilizes great power and force, you should do speed exercises while you are still fresh. Otherwise, you might not be able to reach and push your speed potential.\n\n, In addition to exercises that aim to improve your time, try doing plyometric (explosive) exercises and weight training, such as:\n\n\nJumps\nSquats\nBurpees\nBench press\nLifts\nLeg curls\n\n, It is very important that you take a day to rest between practice sessions. If you try to train for speed while you are sore or fatigued, you will be unsuccessful and risk injuring yourself.\n\n, Make sure that you have a fundamental knowledge of and good practice with soccer skills before attempting to increase your speed.

{"text":" Tobacco is an extremely hardy plant. It grows pretty much where any other agricultural crop will grow, although, as a rule of thumb, tobacco grows better in soils which drain well. The important thing to note is that tobacco will be extremely affected by the soil in which it is grown; lighter soils will generally produce lighter colored tobacco, while darker soils will generally produce darker colored tobacco.;\n, Tobacco requires a frost-free period of 3 to 4 months between transplant and harvest.For best results, tobacco should be ripened without heavy rainfall; excess water causes tobacco plants to become thin and flaky. The ideal temperature for growing tobacco is 68\u00b0 to 86\u00b0 F (20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 C).\n\n, Be sure you place your starting mix in a small flower pot, preferably with holes in the bottom. These seeds should be grown indoors for 4-6 weeks.Seed starting mix consists of compost and other nutrients which promote healthy seed growth. They are available at most gardening and home improvement stores.\nTobacco seeds are extremely small (not much larger than a pin prick), so be sure not to sow them too thickly. Allow adequate spacing between seeds to avoid overcrowding.\nBecause tobacco seeds are so small, it's not advisable to begin them outdoors. Also, their nutrient requirements are different from many other plants, so adding a bit of gravel or special fertilizer designed for tobacco is a good idea.\nTobacco seeds require warm temperatures ranging from 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit to properly germinate. If you aren't growing in a greenhouse, make sure your indoor area meets these temperature requirements.\nDo not cover the seeds with soil since they need light for germination; covering can slow down and even prevent germination from taking place. Seeds should begin to germinate in 7-10 days., The soil should never be allowed to completely dry out.\n\n\nBe extra careful when watering because the force of the water can uproot the freshly emerging tobacco seedlings and cause them to die.If possible, water the seedlings from the bottom. If you used a flower pot with holes in the bottom, set the pot on top of a tray of water. Leave it there for a few seconds so that the water is absorbed by the soil. This will water the seedling without wetting the leaves.\n\n, Your seedlings should be large enough for transplantation if you watered and stored them correctly.\n\n\nTransplanting seedlings to a larger container will allow them to grow a strong and healthy root system.\nTo see if your seedlings are the right size, try grasping them. If you can easily pinch them between your thumb and index finger, they are ready for transplanting. If they are still too small, allow the germination process to continue until they have reached the right size.\nTransplanting tobacco plants bare-root (without soil) directly from the seedling pot to the garden is an easier method, as it only involves one transplantation. However, once planted, the bare-rooted plant can go into \"transplant shock\" where some or most of its largest leaves turn yellow and wilt. After a week, the tobacco plant will begin to flourish once more, but avoiding transplant shock altogether will save you a week of waiting as the potted plant will begin growing immediately once transplanted.\n\n, This should be sufficient food for the plants until they are ready to be transferred to your garden in approximately 3-4 weeks.\n\n\nIf your plant begins to look yellow or look stunted, another dose of fertilizer may be needed. Do so sparingly, however, since over-fertilization while in pots may burn the plants roots or lead to overgrown, spindly plants., Be sure the area you plant the tobacco is constantly exposed to sun, well-drained, and tilled.\n\n\nLack of sun will result in spindly plants, poor growth, and thin leaves. This may not be problematic if you intend on planting tobacco for cigar wrapper use, since growing tobacco under shade can create desirable leaf characteristics.Also test the pH levels of your garden. Tobacco plants need to be planted in moderately acidic soil, otherwise they won't flourish. The soil itself should have a pH of 5.8. Poor growth and some growth disorders may occur if the soil pH is 6.5 or higher.Avoid preparing your garden on soil that is infested with diseases and nematodes. Nematodes are parasitic worms which feed on tobacco and are extremely difficult to exterminate once infestation occurs.\n\n, Space the plants at least 2\u20133 feet (0.6\u20130.9\u00a0m) apart in a row, and space rows 3 1\/2 - 4 feet from each other.\n\n\nTobacco plants are \"heavy feeders,\" meaning they will deplete the nutrients in the soil in about 2 years. To counteract this, employ a 2 year rotation in your growing space by planting for 2 years in a different location and waiting 1 year before transferring it back to its original location.Rather than having an empty garden plot, you could rotate tobacco with plants that are not susceptible to common soil-borne pests, like corn or soybeans., Once they become better established, you can water less frequently to avoid over-watering.\n\n\nKeep the plants well watered without making the soil soggy. If your garden area may experience drought, consider installing an irrigation system. This will prevent the soil from becoming excessively dry, which can then hinder tobacco growth.If you expect a few days of light drizzles or rain, you can water even less frequently. The structure of the tobacco plant's leaves enables the plant to collect and funnel the water down to the base of the plant., Fertilizers used for tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes are also suitable.Over-fertilizing is a serious concern, as it can cause damaging salt accumulation. The application amount will depend largely on the grade of the fertilizer, the natural fertility of the soil, losses of nutrients due to leaching, and other subjective factors. Consult your fertilizer's directions for the most optimal usage.\nIt is recommended that you apply the fertilizer several times. Once the tobacco begins to flower, there should be no need to fertilize further.\n\n, Topping is the removal of the terminal (center) bud and allows the upper leaves to get larger and thicker than if they were untopped.The terminal bud is the most prominent and is typically located at the very top of the stem.The top can be removed by simply breaking or cutting it off, preferably before any flowers open.\nSoon after the top is removed, axillary buds or suckers will develop at each leaf. Remove these by hand as well, otherwise they will reduce the tobacco's yield and quality.\n\n, You can also pull up soil around the base of the plant to help strengthen it.Tobacco roots grow quickly and the root structure is quite large, with thousands of small hair-like feeder roots that grow close to the soil surface. Be careful when tilling or hoeing, as penetrating the soil too deep can damage the roots.\nAfter 3-4 weeks from planting, heavy tilling should be stopped and only light scrapings to control weeds should be done.\n\n, Common tobacco pests include budworms, hornworms, and pathogens.\n\n\nTobacco is subject to infestation by many different bugs and diseases. The rotation process should help reduce the likelihood of infestation, but it is no guarantee.\nIf you still find your tobacco to be infested, many gardening and home improvement stores sell tobacco-specific pesticides. Brand names include \"Nemacor,\" \"Prowl,\" and \"Admire.\" Keep in mind that some pesticides are specifically geared towards insect control on young plants, while others just kill fungus. Find a pesticide which is most suitable to your situation.\n\n, Alternatively, you can remove the leaves from the stalk in the field. Your plants should be ready for harvest about 3 months after planting.\n\n\nStalks should be cut about 3-4 weeks after topping. The lower leaves will be partially deteriorated at this time. If you remove the leaves in the field, there should be 4 or 5 harvests at intervals of 1-2 weeks, starting with the lower leaves. The first harvest should start soon after topping and when the leaves show a slight yellowing.\nFlowers will inhibit the growth of your leaves and will compete for sunlight; removing them is important for obtaining the broadest tobacco leaves possible.\nYou will need to keep the leaves intact because they will be hanged during the curing process. Curing is necessary because it prepares the leaves for consumption; the process produces various compounds in the leaf which give cured tobacco its hay, tea, rose oil, or fruity aromatic flavor. Curing also contributes to the tobacco's \"smoothness\" when consumed.\n\n, The suggested temperature for curing ranges from 65 degrees to 95 degrees Fahrenheit, while the most optimal humidity ranges from 65-70 percent.Be sure to provide adequate space between the stalks to allow for satisfactory drying of the leaves.\nProper curing should take a few weeks in order to achieve good quality. Tobacco that cures too fast will be green and will likely not have good aroma or flavor. Leaves that cure too slow may develop mold or rot. Be sure to monitor your tobacco leaves closely for these signs and adjust your temperature\/humidity accordingly.\nIf curing leaves on the stalk, remove the leaves from the stalk once curing has completed.\nA building that can be opened and closed as needed to control the humidity and drying rate is ideal. Some producers of homegrown tobacco have built curing facilities and may offer them for sale.Air curing tobacco is primarily reserved for cigar use. Tobacco can also be cured using fire, the sun, or can be flue-cured. Fire-cured tobacco typically takes between 10-13 weeks and is used to make pipe tobacco and chewing tobacco. Sun-cured and flue-cured tobacco is used in cigarettes.\n\n, Commercial tobacco is typically aged for a year or more, but aging your own tobacco can take up to 5-6 years.\n\n\nAging will not occur if the temperature and moisture content is perfect. If the tobacco is too dry, it will not age; if it is too moist, it will rot. Unfortunately, the proper temperature and humidity vary widely and will require some experimentation on your part.\nMonitor your leaves closely during the aging process to ensure that they remain moist, yet rot free. Aging is not an exact science and will require impromptu adjustments when necessary.Aging your tobacco leaves is optional, but know that un-aged tobacco is often harsh and lacks good flavor.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":571}

{"text":" For this recipe you will need the following items: Paring knife\nZester\nSaucepan\nCandy thermometer\nCandy molds\nAirtight storage container.;\n, Start by peeling the ginger with a paring knife or vegetable peeler. Fresh ginger is available at most supermarkets in the produce section.\nGinger has anti-inflammatory properties and is commonly used in cough remedies as an effective antihistamine and chest decongestant.Cut the ginger into very thin slices using a paring knife.\nUse a zester to get at least 1 teaspoon of lemon zest.\n\n, Bring this to a boil over high heat.You will know when the pot is at a full boil when you have a constant stream of large bubbles coming to the surface and a good deal of steam.\nOnce the pot has come to a full boil, reduce the heat to low.\n\n, Then remove the ginger and cinnamon stick. The easiest way to remove the spices is with a strainer.\nPlace a strainer into a clean saucepan.\nPour the hot mixture through the strainer.\nThe ginger and cinnamon will be left in the strainer and the liquid will be caught in the clean saucepan underneath.\n\n, Bring this mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Honey has been studied in clinical trials. It has been proven to be as effective as cough syrup in suppressing coughs. You will want the sugar to dissolve.\nYou can tell if the sugar is dissolved if you take a spoon of the liquid and cannot see any grains of sugar in it.\nOnce the sugar is dissolved, you will use a candy thermometer to get this syrup to the hard-crack candy stage.\n\n, You will use this to monitor the heat.The candy liquid will need to be heated to a high temperature in order to harden into lozenges.\nIt is very important that you closely watch the temperature of the syrup so it doesn't burn onto the saucepan or become too hot to form hard cough drops.\nThe goal temperature for hard-crack lozenges is 300-305 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n, It will rise quickly as you cook the liquid.As the liquid rises in temperature, it may darken. This is expected as the sugar in the syrup caramelizes.\nWhen the candy thermometer reaches 300-305 degrees, remove the liquid from heat.\nYou will now add the final ingredients before pouring the mixture to cool in candy molds.\n\n,\nAs you add the juice, it may cause the hot liquid to splash.\nStir completely to make sure the liquid is evenly mixed.\n\n, You can use unflavored cooking spray to do so. Carefully pour the hot liquid into the molds.\nTake care to fill only the small candy mold and not to spill too much of the liquid over the top each.\nThis recipe will make about 50 small lozenge sized pieces.\n\n, This will take an hour or more.When the cough drops are cool, crack them out of the molds onto wax paper.\nTo crack the drops out of the candy molds, tap the mold gently on a hard surface. The cough drops should fall out.\nYou may have to bend the candy mold tray in order to get the cough drops out, similar to cracking ice.\n\n, If you don't have superfine sugar at home, you can put regular granulated sugar in a food processor or blender. Process this until it is a finer consistency.Shake the jar to coat the cough drops with sugar.\nThis will prevent them from sticking together.\nYou can also use powdered sugar to coat the drops, but it tends to clump.\n\n, You don't need to refrigerate them.Use them as needed.\nSince these don't contain any of the common drugs found in cough syrups, these are ideal if you want to avoid the side effects of over-the-counter cough remedies.\nThe cough drops will have a pleasant, sweet taste of lemon, ginger, and cinnamon.\n\n, There are several suggestions for herbal medicines that are effective at treating coughs and colds. Elderberry and elderflower has been used to relieve congestion. Slippery elm has been traditionally used by Native Americans to treat coughs and gastrointestinal conditions.Chamomile may be an effective treatment for coughs as it can help to reduce inflammation and mucus production.To make a strong tea, place a generous pinch of each herb into a cup of water in a saucepan.\nHeat the water and herbs to a simmer on high heat, then cover and reduce the heat.\nLet the tea steep for 15 to 20 minutes over the lowest heat.\nStrain out the herbs and reserve 1\/2 cup of the tea for the cough drops.\n\n, You can make DIY molds rather than using candy molds to make cough drops using sugar and a baking sheet.In a 9 x 13 pan or any cookie sheet, add a few cups of powdered sugar.\nUse your finger or a measuring spoon to make indentations in the sugar.\nThis is where you will pour the syrup for your cough lozenges.\n\n, Start by putting the 1\/2 cup of herbal tea from Step 1 into a saucepan, then add 1.5 cups of honey and 1\/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract.Use a medium to medium-high heat to heat up the ingredients.\nStir constantly to make sure all the ingredients are mixed.\nClip a candy thermometer on the side of the pan to monitor the temperature.\n\n, You will want it to get to about 300\u00a0\u00b0F (149\u00a0\u00b0C). This will allow the liquid to harden into lozenges as it cools.The mixture may get slightly foamy as it heats up.\nIf this occurs, give the cough drop liquid a stir.\nYou will be able to tell once the mixture gets near to the correct temperature as it will thicken.\nThis process generally takes about 30 minutes.\nOnce the liquid is at a temperature of 300 degrees, remove it from the heat.\n\n, Pour slowly and carefully.Pour the hot liquid into each of the small depressions in the powdered sugar on the baking sheet you prepared earlier.\nAlternatively, you can use a greased candy mold.\nIf you don't have a candy mold or don't want to use sugar, you can pour the liquid onto a piece of greased parchment paper. Be aware that this is the messiest way to do this.\n\n, Try not to disturb the cough drops as they cool.Once the drops have cooled, carefully move them out of their sugar molds. If using candy molds, crack the cough drops out of the molds.\nCoat the cough drops in powdered sugar.\nYou can store these in single layers between wax paper in the refrigerator for about 3 weeks.\nYou can also freeze them between layers of wax paper. If you choose to do so, they will last for several months.\n\n, This recipe calls for slippery elm powder, cinnamon, honey, orange essential oil and lemon essential oil.You can buy slippery elm bark and the essential oils from most health food stores, herbal shops, or online herbal retailers such as Mountain Rose Herbs.\nSlippery elm contains a substance called mucilage. This becomes gel-like when combined with water or honey. This can help coat the mouth, throat, and digestive tract.Native Americans used this herbal remedy for centuries to calm coughs and gastrointestinal problems.Slippery elm has not been shown to cause any medical complications, unlike other herbal supplements. Little formal research has been conducted to show how effective it is at treating medical conditions. Remember that clinical studies have shown that honey is a very effective treatment for coughs. Cinnamon may also have some effectiveness at controlling a bad cough., Stir very thoroughly to combine.If the honey is too stiff has crystallized, try warming up the jar under warm water.\nThis should thin the honey or reconstitute it.\nSometimes this mixture is very dry and crumbly. If this is the case, you can add two more tablespoons of honey to make it easier to work with.\nWhen finished the mixture should resemble a soft dough. It may be sticky because of the honey.\n\n, Use a dropper to make sure you get the right amount of drops for each.You will need 10 drops of orange essential oil and 6 drops of lemon essential oil.\nMix these into the cough lozenge mixture thoroughly.\nYou want to make sure they are incorporated evenly into the dough.\n\n, These should be roughly the size of a teaspoon.Place these on a sheet of wax paper or parchment.\nYou can lay this on a counter or a baking sheet.\nPlace the lozenges in an area where they won't be disturbed.\nThese cough lozenges may not be very attractive but they contain effective ingredients.\n\n, You may need to leave them longer if you live in a humid climate.To store the lozenges, wrap them in wax paper.\nAlternatively, you can store them in an airtight jar.\nThese will last approximately 3 weeks when stored properly.\nThe recipe should make about 36 lozenges.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":575}
{"text":" If a new player asks how to play Mao, you have to tell them it's a frustrating card game and that you can't tell them the rules; they have to find out the specifics themselves. There is no limit to the number of players in a game, but you'll want a deck for every 4 to 5 players, maybe more if you have new players or complicated rules and are likely to need a lot of penalty cards.\n\n, He or she has the authority to initiate the game, choose what rules to use, judge and resolve disputes, and deal with any unusual complications that might arise.\n\n\nSince the dealer may be the only player who knows all the rules from the beginning of the game, it is critical that he or she enforces them consistently and fairly.\nSome groups prefer to have a second player who also knows the rules so that the two of them can call penalties on each other.\n\n, 5 to 8 cards per player is typical, but the exact amount doesn't matter as long as everyone gets the same number. Place the remainder of the deck in the center of the playing area to be used as a stock of penalty cards, then flip one card over and place it next to the deck to start.\n\n,, They vary with every game. Look below for guidelines to figuring out rules for each particular game of Mao.\n\n, In fact, no talking at all except when required by another rule, to call a point of order, or when in the middle of a point of order.;\n, Counterintuitive as this seems, you have to do it when mandated or else you'll receive another penalty card.\n\n, The game is similar to Uno in this respect, because you have to alert all the other players that you're close to winning, and if you don't you can be penalized.\n\n, Additionally, no playing out of turn or trying to call a penalty on another player if that player hasn't broken any rules--if you're going to disrupt the game, it's better not to play at all. If a player unintentionally inflicts a penalty on another player because they themselves do not fully understand the rules, any other player except the one penalized can inflict a penalty card on the first player for \"inflicting an incorrect penalty\".\n\n, They will then end their turn by adding this card to their hand.\n\n, A point of order occurs when the game comes to a halt so the players can confer and discuss to clarify certain things about the game, although they still cannot talk about the rules directly. Points of order are an important part of the Mao process, and come with their own rules, which are:\n\n\nDo not refer to the point of order directly by name (you can get around this by calling it \"P of O\", for example, or simply \"point order\", eliminating the \"of\")\nPlayers must not look at their cards during a Point of order. If they are still holding their cards after someone calls a Point of order, they can be penalized.\nThe point of order ends when someone calls \"point of disorder\", \"point taken\", or even just \"pick up your cards\"\nIn some variations, only the dealer can start and end points of order; however, you can allow anyone to do so in your game\nIn another variation, point of order must be said before and after you speak during play. Players who do not do so will be penalized for \"speaking out of turn.\"\n\n,,\nRequiring a player to draw penalty cards\nChanging which cards can be legally played to the discard pile\nRequiring a player to make a choice (such as specifying the value of a wild card).\n\n, It's up to you!\n\n\nMusical Chairs. A Four of Clubs forces everyone to get up from the table, run around once and sit back down in their original spot. The last player to make it back to their spot draws a penalty card.\nDeuces. A Two requires everyone to touch their middle and index fingers to the table. The last player to do so draws a penalty card.\nHave a Nice Day. A seven requires the next player to draw a penalty card. Sevens can add up, requiring players to draw 2, 3, 4, etc. penalty cards when multiple 7's are played in a row. Whoever plays it must say \"Have a (Very) (Very, Very) (etc.) Nice Day.\nRoyalty. A King requires a player to say \"All Hail the King (of spades)\". A Queen requires the player to say \"Neeumph\" (Queen of Spades).\nManners. A person must say \"Thank You\" when dealt a penalty card.\nSoap. Any cursing results in a penalty card.\nHoliday. A six requires a player to say \"Merry Christmas\".\nJacks. A Jack allows a player to change suits (wild card).\nSpades. Spade cards must be named when played.\nAces. Aces cause the next player to skip their turn.\nReverse. An eight causes the turn order to reverse.\nRhyme Fest. A nine causes the person who played it to say a word and all other players must say a rhyming word in turn without stating a previously said word. If a player says a non-rhyming word, takes too long to say a rhyming word, or says a previously stated word, he draws a penalty card.\nChauncey. If two identical cards are played in succession, everyone must say \"Chauncey\". The last player to do so draws a penalty card.\nDiamonds. If any card with a suit of a diamond is played, the person who played it must say \"Shine bright like a diamond\".\nChange of Suit. If a person plays a card with a different suit, but the same letter or number as the previous card played (Thus changing the suit), then the person who played the card that would be changing the suit must knock once on the surface of which the game is being played on (Such as a table).\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":576}
{"text":" These challenges vary widely from individual to individual, because they are directly related to the specific areas of your brain that are affected by the condition.;\n, Most people have a blend to the two challenges (called \"expressive\" and \"receptive\" language skills), with one being more of a problematic than the other (however, which one is more burdensome could change as the condition progresses).\n\n\nDepending upon the type of language challenge you are faced with, some people find it helpful to learn alternate modes of communication such as gesturing and\/or pointing.\nThe mainstay of treatment is to focus on the strengths you have (i.e. the skills you have preserved) when it comes to language and communication, and to adapt your form of communication to rely as much as possible on your strengths, while avoiding your weaknesses. This is because your weaknesses will likely only continue to deteriorate with time, given that they signify the area with brain damage.Unfortunately, sign language does not work as an alternative mode of communication for people with progressive aphasia, as it relies on the same areas of the brain that are already damaged due to the disease.Using apps on an iPhone or an iPad that can speak for a person may be of help.\nHaving family members and friends communicate simply and clearly can also aid with comprehension.\n\n, All she can do is help you to develop strategies to manage your condition most effectively, and to preserve your language and communication abilities for as long as possible by working with you on adaptive techniques.\n\n\nIt is important to know that the condition cannot be cured, so as not to have unrealistically high expectations of the therapist you are working with.\n\n, Not only does it aid in not feeling alone, but you may also pick up valuable tips and strategies by seeing how others have coped with their illness.\n\n\nCheck to see if there is an Aphasia Community Group in your area.\n\n, To avoid the confusion of others not understanding your difficulties, some people find it helpful to carry printed information about their illness and to bring it with them to public or social situations.\n\n\nYou may wish to carry an ID card with you, if introducing yourself clearly and coherently is a problem.\nYou may also wish to carry a small amount of printed information detailing your condition and explaining how it is best for people to interact with you, as this can help to smooth your ability to fit in socially.\n\n, Because progressive aphasia is a condition that is usually mild at the start, and progresses at a slow rate, many people can continue working for several years even after being diagnosed with the condition. You may wish to let your boss know that you have the condition, and\/or to ask for modified duties should you find that it is interfering with your ability to effectively communicate (either in written or spoken language) in your current job.\n\n\nYou may also wish to look into whether you have any employee insurance or other health care coverage that can help with medical appointments, and\/or with paid time off work.\n\n, In progressive aphasia, you will have only language and communication deficits on exam. You will have no other mental challenges, such as problems with your memory, with your physical ability to perform day-to-day tasks, or with any of your other thinking processes.\n\n\nYour doctor can run through a series of cognitive tests with you to rule out other common conditions, such as Alzheimer's dementia.\n\n, Your doctor will be able to rule out other conditions such as a stroke or a traumatic brain injury by performing a neurological exam, as well as by offering you a head CT or MRI which can give further insight into any anatomical or structural problems.\n\n\nProgressive aphasia will show shrinkage of certain brain tissues (related to the language functions) on CT scan.\nHowever, the appearance of progressive aphasia can be differentiated on imaging from a stroke or a traumatic brain injury.\n\n, Progressive aphasia occurs when brain cells in the areas related to language malfunction and die. It is usually caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). (It is important to note that Alzheimer\u2019s disease is not the same as Alzheimer's dementia.)FTLD occurs when parts of the brain atrophy or shrink,and AD is caused by microscopic abnormalities in the brain.When FTLD and AD occur in the areas of brain that control speech and language, the person develops progressive aphasia.Progressive aphasia is caused by FTLD in 60\u201370% of cases and AD in 30\u201340%. Whether progressive aphasia is caused by FTLD or AD can only be determined by autopsy.In most cases, progressive aphasia is not genetic.Remember that progressive aphasia is not the same as Alzheimer's dementia \u2014 while language skills degenerate, the person should be completely functional otherwise. A person with progressive aphasia usually can continue taking care of himself and pursue hobbies and interests.A person with Alzheimer's dementia will experience a progressive loss of all cognitive function, not just speech.Progressive aphasia is also not caused by brain trauma, stroke, tumor, or infection., This condition is one that is not curable, and can only be managed as best as possible as it continues to progress gradually with time. (This is another feature that differentiates it from a stroke or a traumatic brain injury, as both of these can show improvements with time and a slow regaining of function, rather than a continual deterioration.)\n\n\nWhen you understand that the goal is to effectively manage the condition, rather than to cure it, it can help you to go into your doctor's and therapist's appointments with realistic expectations in terms of what they can do for you.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":577}
{"text":" If they are extremely tight, spray some lubricant on the nuts - a silicone lubricant or even vegetable oil will do the trick very well. (Many modern bikes will not have nuts. They have a quick-release which you can easily loosen and remove the wheel).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n, Every brake setup is a little different but you should likely be able to slip the brake cable out of a socket on the brake arms to release them. Some brakes may require that you loosen the cable from a clamped position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, If it's the rear wheel, you will need to lift the chain clear of the gear cluster. To ease the removal of a rear wheel, shift the chain to the smallest gear on the wheel before loosening the skewer or nuts. If it's the front wheel, it will be easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, With a presta valve you need to unscrew the top part of the stem to release the air in the tube. During this step you'll also want to remove the lock ring that screws onto the stem and sits flush on the rim if your bike has one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, With all the air out of the tube squeeze the tire together and you'll see the tire release from the inside of the rim, this will help when removing the tire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You can use the handle of a spoon or similar object if you don't have tire levers but be very careful, as you risk scratching or damaging the rims of the wheel and\/or puncturing the inner tube. Ease one lever in under the wheel rim and lever out the edge of the tire (taking great care not to puncture the inner tube) and pry it up over the wheel rim. Move around the rim about an eighth of the circumference and repeat the process again, leaving the first tool in place. Now zip the second lever around the wheel and the tire should come right off on one side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,, Best way to find an air leak is by inserting the tube with air in water. Where air bubbles come out , there is a hole in your tube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Use caution when feeling inside the tire as a nail, or glass can cut you. Be sure to remove any thorns, glass, or nails with pliers if you find them. Adjust rim tape to cover protruding spoke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Unwrap your new tube and remove the plastic dust cap and the lock ring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Putting a few pumps of air in the tube before will help to avoid pinching the tube when putting the tire on the rim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This process is difficult but try not to use tire levers, a screwdriver, or other similar object as you vastly increase your chance of puncturing your new tube. Check the tire wall for an arrow or similar to indicate the direction of rotation - some tires have a \"direction specific\" tread pattern. Put one side in first, then ease the partially inflated tube into the tire and put the other side on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,,,,,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":578}
{"text":" Contract the corners of your mouth to form a round shape with your mouth before phrases like \u201cOh dear\u201d or \u201cMinnes-ohhh-ta\u201d and extend the emphasis on this vowel.\n\n\nThis is a similarity to Canadian accents in some areas.\nPractice by saying the word \u201cSound\u201d. While it only has one syllable and can be said quickly, a Minnesotan might say \u201cS-ownd\u201d or \u201cS-ow-und\u201d as a part of regular speech.;\n, The \u201cI\u201d should be drawn out and spoken with the mouth open and the tongue behind the bottom front teeth. This is also true when using names and words with the letter \u201cy\u201d.\n\n\nPractice by saying the word \u201cWhy\u201d and drawing out the vowel.\n\n, For example, the words \u201care,\u201d \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cmother\u201d rely more heavily on the letter \u201cR\u201d in the Minnesota dialect. Stress the \u201cerr\u201d sound.\n\n\nTry saying the phrase \u201cOh, dear\u201d to practice the \u201cO\u201d and the \u201cR\u201d together. It can sound like \u201cOo-ha, De-arr\u201d.\n\n, This is often called \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d because they use an inquisitive tone when speaking with other people. There are several changes in tone throughout a sentence.\n\n\nUse the phrase \u201cOh, that\u2019s interesting\u201d. Although it is a statement and shouldn\u2019t end with an inflection, the Midwestern accent would include an upward inflection with the word \u201cinteresting\u201d. it is basically being passive in an aggressive way.\n\n, Thanks to a large influx of Swedish and Norwegian immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries, the Minnesota accent has a sing-song quality, employing inflections and words like \u201cYah\u201d for \u201cYes\u201d.Try the comic phrase \u201cYa sure, you betcha\u201d to practice your use of the regional pronunciation.\n\n, For example, \u201cHave to\u201d is often \u201chafta\u201d, while \u201cI\u2019m going to\u201d is \u201ceye-mina\u201d and \u201cwhat are you\u201d is \u201cwhat-cha\u201d.\n\n, It is a generic, but common reply to questions like \u201cYou doing alright?\u201d or \u201cAre you full?\u201d\n\n, Almost all of Minnesota and most of the Midwest call Coke, Pepsi and other sodas \u201cpop\u201d.\n\n, For example, \u201cI didn\u2019t buy that dress because it was too spendy\u201d.\n\n, Other like \u201ccan\u201d are pronounced with a similar soft \u201ceh\u201d sound.\n\n, This phrase and \u201cNice to meet you\u201d are used to indicate you\u2019d like to depart. You also might want to draw out your goodbye like a true Minnesotan and talk about the weather, sports, and politics. This is known as the \"Minnesotan goodbye\".\n\n, For example, \u201ccash\u201d is sometimes pronounced \u201ccaish\u201d. The word \u201cdifferent\u201d is often pronounced with two syllables as \u201cdiff-rent\u201d.,, This is the act of being outwardly nice, without conveying your real opinions or emotions. It is often referred to as \u201cpassive aggressive\u201d or \u201centhusiastic neutral\u201d tone because of the friendly inflections while saying something negative.\n\n, This form of non-verbal communication is used when driving and greeting oncoming cars or pedestrians. You lift your index finger off the steering wheel for a second and set it back down.\n\n, If someone asks your opinion and you want to show a little opinion, \u201cthat\u2019s different\u201d will show that you don\u2019t like it, without having to go into detail., Minnesotans may talk while at a 45-degree angle or while looking out at something else. This is a way of remaining nice, non-confrontational, but not too personal.\n\n, It\u2019s better to say \u201cNot bad\u201d than \u201cNot good\u201d.\n\n\nPronounce \u201cNot Bad\u201d as \u201cNaaht Bah-d\u201d.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":579}

Sons, daughters, stepchildren, foster children, and siblings generally are included as qualifying children for the purposes of this credit.If your total income for the year will be between $65,000 and $84,000, or between $100,000 and $119,000 if you are married filing jointly, enter a \"1\" for each qualifying child in the blank for line G.If your total income will be less than $65,000, or less than $100,000 if you are married filing jointly, enter \"2\" for each qualifying child. Subtract one if you have between two and four qualifying children; subtract two if you have five or more qualifying children.For example, if you have three children, you would enter \"5\" in the blank for line G: 2 + 2 + 2 - 1 = 5.\n\n,, If you plan to itemize your deductions, you'll need to complete the Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet. If you have more than one job, or if you're married and both you and your spouse work, you'll need to fill out the Two-Earners\/Multiple Jobs Worksheet.If neither of those descriptions applies to you, you can enter the amount from line H directly into line 5 on your withholding allowance certificate., In the boxes numbered 1 and 2, you will enter your first and last name, address, and Social Security number., In box 3, you must check the appropriate square to indicate whether you are single, married, or married but want taxes withheld from your paycheck at the higher single rate.You are considered single if you are unmarried, divorced, or legally separated according to state law. You also are considered single if you are married but your spouse is a nonresident of the United States.\nYou are considered married if you are married according to state law. If your relationship status on the last day of the year is \"married,\" then for the purposes of federal taxes you are married for the entire year.You can choose to withhold taxes at a single rate, which is higher, if you are married but would prefer to have more money kept from your paycheck., Take the number you entered in line H of your Personal Allowance Worksheet, or the result from the other worksheets you needed to use on the second page, and write it in box 5., You may want additional money withheld, for example if you have other taxes such as self-employment taxes to pay.If you do, write down that amount as a dollar figure in box 6., If you had no tax liability last year, and expect a full refund this year, you can write \"exempt\" in box 7., You've finished filling out the form, but it isn't valid until you sign and date it, declaring under penalty of perjury that all the information you provided is true and complete.When you've completed and signed your form, return it to your employer. Check your pay stubs to ensure the proper amount of money is being withheld each pay period.\n\n, You may want to add allowances if you received a large refund and would like to keep more money in your paycheck. In contrast, you may want to decrease your number of allowances if you had to pay the IRS last year.\n\n\nIf any event happens that changes your withholding status, such as a birth or a divorce, you must file a new W-4 with your employer within 10 days of the event's occurrence., You should use this worksheet only if you plan on itemizing your deductions such as mortgage interest, or taking certain credits or adjustments.This worksheet also takes into account other non-wage income you might have, such as dividends and interest.\n\n, Deductions reduce your tax liability. You can take the standard deduction, or itemize your deductions. Typically people choose to itemize their deductions when their total itemized deductions are greater than the standard deduction.For example, suppose you are single when you file your taxes in 2015. Your standard deduction would be $6,300. When you add up your itemized deductions, the total is $5,000. In that situation, you probably would choose to take the standard deduction.Enter the dollar amount of your estimated itemized deductions in the blank on line 1., The worksheet provides the standard deduction amounts based on your filing status. For example, if you are married filing jointly in 2015, you would enter $12,600 on line 2.\n\n, If the result of that calculation is zero or a negative number, write \"0\" in the blank on line 3. To continue the previous example, subtracting $6,300 from $5,000 would produce a negative number, so you'd enter \"0\" on line 3., and enter that amount on line 4. Adjustments, also called \"above-the-line deductions,\" are amounts such as IRA contributions or student loan interest that you claim directly on your 1040 or 1040A.To continue the example, suppose you paid $2,000 in student loan interest that you planned to claim on your taxes. You would enter $2,000 on line 4.\n\n, This is the total amount of deductions, credits, and adjustments you estimate you will claim in the year you fill out the W-4. If you are claiming tax credits, you will have to complete an additional worksheet to convert those credits to withholding allowances.The total in the example for line 5 would be $7,000.\n\n, Non-wage income includes money you receive without working for it, such as interest or alimony.If you received $500 in interest income, for example, you'd enter $500 on line 6.\n\n, If the result is zero or a negative number, enter \"0.\"To continue the example, you would subtract $500 from $7,000. The result is not zero or a negative number, so you would enter the result of $6,500 on line 7.\n\n, In the example, you would divide $6,500 by $4,000 and the result would be 1.625. You would drop the decimals and enter \"1\" on line 8., Since in the example you are single with no dependents, you have \"1\" on line H as well.\n\n, If you're planning on completing the Two-Earners\/Multiple Jobs Worksheet, enter the total on the first line of that worksheet. If you don't need that worksheet, enter this number on line 5 of your Withholding Allowance Certificate.To finish up the example, you would enter \"2\" on your Withholding Allowance Certificate.\n\n, The Two-Earners\/Multiple Jobs Worksheet is designed to make sure that single people with more than one job, or married couples who both work, have the correct amount of taxes withheld from their paychecks.You should only use this worksheet if the instructions under line H on your Personal Allowance Worksheet directed you to do so., However, if the highest paying job pays $65,000 or less, you should not enter a number greater than \"3.\"\n\n,\n\n\nIf the number on line 1 is greater than or equal to the number on line 2, subtract line 2 from line 1. Enter that number on line 3 and on line 5 of your Withholding Allowance Certificate, and you are done with this worksheet.If the number on line 1 is less than the number on line 2, enter \"0\" on line 5 of your Withholding Allowance Certificate. You should then complete the rest of the worksheet to figure out what additional amount to have withheld from your paycheck. This will help you avoid having to pay the IRS when you file your taxes., If you entered \"0\" on line 5, the worksheet includes some additional calculations so you won't be facing a big tax bill in April.Line 4 instructs you to enter the number from line 2 of the same worksheet. This was the number that corresponded to the lowest paying job. Assume, for example, that number was \"3.\"\nOn line 5 you'll need to enter the number from line 1 on the same worksheet, which was the final number you arrived at on line 10 of your Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet. To continue the example, assume that number was \"1.\"\nNow subtract line 5 from line 4 and enter the result in line 6. In the example, the result would be \"2.\"\nUsing table 2 provided on the worksheet, find the amount that corresponds to the highest paying job. Assume you are married filing jointly, and your highest paying job pays $50,000 a year. According to the table, you should enter $600 on line 7.\nNow multiply line 7 by line 6 and enter the result on line 8. This is the total amount of additional withholding needed. In the example, that number would be $1,200.\nAll you need to do now is divide that number by the number of pay periods remaining in the year. This depends on how often you're paid and what time of year you start. If you started the job for which you're filling out a W-4 in February and will be paid monthly, you would divide $1,200 by 10 because there are 10 pay periods left in the year. The result of that calculation, $120, is the additional amount of money that needs to be withheld from your paychecks. This is the amount you'd enter on your Withholding Allowance Certificate.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":581}

{"text":" When your child learns to express himself in words and shows a desire to use the phone, it's the right time to explain the purpose of the number 911.;\n, Explain to your child that 911 is the number to call to ask for help during an emergency. Luckily, it is a simple, short code that children can easily remember.\n\n, Explain to your child what services they can reach when they call 911. For example:\n\n\nExplain the role of a police officer. Tell the child that a police officer can help if they think that there is some threat to their safety, like someone breaking into the house, etc.\nExplain the role of doctors\/paramedics. Tell the child that doctor or paramedics can help if someone is seriously injured in an accident, if someone falls ill, passes out, etc.\nExplain the role of a fireman. Tell your child that the firemen can come in case of a fire, a flood, or if someone needs to be rescued from an unsafe situation.\n\n, Explain to the child who the dispatcher is. This is the person who receives the 911 calls from people who need help. The dispatcher asks questions, collects information, and sends help. Tell your child that they should not be afraid to talk to this person.\n\n, The child needs to be made aware of the situations in which it's appropriate for them to make a 911 call. These situations include:\n\n\nWhen the child sees a fire, smells smoke, or the fire alarm is activated.\nIf the child witnesses a crime, or believes that his or someone else's safety is endangered.\nIf the child was in an accident where people were injured, or if they are injured themselves.\nIf someone is sick and needs medical help, either on the street or at home.\nIf the child is lost and does not know where he is or how to contact his parents.\n\n, However, it's also important to explain to your child the situations in which it is not appropriate to call 911. Explain to your child that the policemen, doctors and firemen are very busy people and do not have time to respond to calls that are not serious. Examples of non-serious situations might include:\n\n\nIf the child has an escaped pet.\nIf the child falls and scratches their knee.\nIf the child breaks or loses his bike.\n\n, Let your child know that he or she should never call 911 out of boredom or for a joke. Explain that in some countries, this is even a criminal offense. Also explain that by calling 911 unnecessarily, they may be blocking the line for someone who really needs help.\n\n, Explain to the child that 911 should be called from a safe location. Explain to your child that they must get away from any dangerous places and ensure that their life is not in danger before making the call.\n\n\nFor example, if there is a fire, the child should leave the house before calling. If they think that someone has broken into the house, they should try to get out and go to a neighbor's before calling.\nHowever, there are also situations where the child should stay exactly where they are. For example, if someone is sick or injured, the child should stay with them. Let them know that the dispatcher who answers the 911 call can give them information on how to help the sick or injured person., Talk to your child about possible emergencies. Explain the possible situations in which a child should call 911. Encourage your child to name all these situations.\n\n\nAsk questions such as: \u201cWhat will you do when you see a car accident?\u201d or \u201cWhat would you do if you were alone at home, and see that mom is not well?\u201d \u201cWhat if your friend fell, hit his head and lost consciousness?\"\nThis will help your child to recognize the specific situations in which they might need to call 911. This preparation could be vital when it comes to an actual emergency.\n\n, The child must know their own address, name, last name, and parents\u2019 names. Explain that this is because the dispatcher will ask him who is calling, what the emergency is and where it is located, in order to send help.\n\n\nIf someone in the family suffers from a chronic illness and has frequent problems, instruct the child to call 911 when they see certain symptoms. Write down the name of the disease or condition on a piece of paper and make sure the child knows where to find it.\nIn this way, the child will be able to provide this vital information to the dispatcher, which can be extremely helpful once the ambulance arrives.\n\n, Teach your child how to describe their surroundings, in case the emergency happens outside of the home and the child doesn't know where they are.\n\n\nTeach your child to look for stress signs or distinct characteristics of the buildings around them. This will help the dispatcher to send an ambulance\/firetruck\/police car to the correct location as quickly as possible., Instruct your child not to panic when they are making the 911 call. Explain that they need to talk to the dispatcher as slowly and calmly as possible.\n\n\nTell them to answer any questions that the dispatcher might have, in order to give as much information as possible.\nTell them to listen carefully to the dispatcher and to try to follow any instructions the dispatcher gives as closely as possible.\n\n, If the child does not wait until the end of the call, they might miss out on providing or receiving vital information that could affect someone\u2019s life.\n\n, If your accidentally call 911, explain to them that they should not hang up. Tell them they should wait for the dispatcher to answer and then explain that there is no emergency.\n\n\nOtherwise, the dispatcher may locate the call and send help where it is not needed, wasting resources and potentially delaying help to someone who really needs it.\n\n, Have at least one telephone that the child can easily reach and access all times. It's no use teaching them how to call 911 if they can't get to a phone in case of emergency.\n\n, Make sure your child knows how to use a cell phone and how to unlock it. Teach your child the password (if you have one) and show them how to get to the keyboard from the home screen.\n\n, Older phones (such as those at grandma's and grandpa's house) may have a circular dialer. If this is the case, your should show your child how to call from such a phone.\n\n\nA finger should be placed at the desired number and the dialer should be turned to the right, all the way to the end.\n\n, Explain to the child that 911 means nine-one-one. Never refer to it as nine-hundred-and-eleven or nine-eleven. In a critical situation, the child may lose time if they expect the phone's keyboard to have the number eleven or ninety-one.\n\n\nTo younger children, explain the difference between the numbers 6 and 9. Point out that 9 has a circle which is above as its head, and that 6 has a circle at the bottom, like it's sitting on it.\n\n, This is the best way for children to learn and the best way to assess the skills of your child Let the child wait for dial tone (you can act it out or play a recording tone from another phone to prepare the child for how the tone sounds)\n\n\nLet the child act out calling 911. First the number 9, then 1, and then 1 again.\nAct the part of the dispatcher. Ask questions like who's calling, where are you calling from and why.\nTeach your child to speak loudly. Get them to repeat information if they didn't say it loudly enough and encourage them to ask you (the dispatcher) to explain again if they aren't clear on the instructions., You can make an appointment with a local dispatcher to do a practice call with your child. Call 911 and ask the dispatcher if he is free to practice with your child right now or if he need to make an appointment.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":583}
{"text":" Obviously, if you are faking sick on the weekend so you can avoid going to school on Monday, you will be busy faking sick and won't have much time to do the things you enjoy. If there's something you definitely want to do, try to squeeze it in quickly before faking your \"sickness\".;\n, Either way, both are a perfect choice. If you start the sickness too early on Saturday, you will have to keep up the masquerade all weekend and Monday, and it will be very hard and your chances of succeeding in fooling your parents that you're sick will be limited and slim.\n\n, Make sure it is something that you don't get often, because if you have faked sick before and used the same excuse too many times, don't try it again or your parents will become suspicious of whether you are really sick or not. If you choose to start the \"sickness\" faking in the night hours of Saturday, go to your parents' room at roughly 11:00pm or 1:00am, or any time between those two, maybe a bit later, and complain of whatever sickness it is you're using.\n\n, Your parents, if they are the sort that try to convince you, \"it was just a dream, there's no monsters\", you are likely to be tucked back into your own bed, but if your parents understand how freaked out you get after nightmares, they'll probably let you stay in their room until the night is over. If they do this, say that you feel like you're going to vomit and go and get a bucket, bowl or plastic bag for you to \"vomit\" in. This way, your parents will think that you really are sick and won't suspect you of going to so much trouble simply to fake sickness.\n\n,, or \"How will I get through P.E. feeling so sick?\" but make sure you only point out things they know you enjoy doing.\n\n, Also, remember to delete your computer's internet history or else your parents will definitely send you to school Monday.\n\n, Beware, though, you also must sacrifice your Monday and be \"sick\" for the whole of that day.\n\n, Also remember to be very, very convincing that you are sick because Monday is the day most kids choose to fake sickness, because they want an extra day off and are not ready for the weekend to end.\n\n, Stay under the covers a lot and breathe on your hands, then rub them on your face, but if a thermometer is involved, try breathing on it behind your parents' backs, but if it becomes too hot your parents will suspect you of being seriously ill and needing the hospital, or they will know you are faking sickness and had breathed on the thermometer.\n\n, Find something like baby powder and put it all over your face, then wash all off but it will leave a slightly pale effect. If you are pale, your parents will be more likely to believe that you're sick.\n\n, Don't eat anything that's offered to you, but if you do accept it only pick off a little bit and chew it slowly to show that you've lost your appetite and definitely are sick. If your parents are insistent on you eating something, tell them \"I'm not hungry!\" but not too rudely or loudly. They might reconsider your \"sickness\" if you have the energy to be yelling and objecting.\n\n, Ask for covers and fake sleeping. If you tend to twitch a lot when you fake sleeping, pull the covers right over you. Your parents are likely, though, to peer into the covers and see how you're doing. Some tips to making sure you fool them into thinking you're really sleeping are:\n\n\nDon't move a lot. When they're not looking, if you're uncomfortable move slightly. Only move about every 20 minutes or so. If you keep tossing and turning, they're going to know for sure that you're not actually sleeping and are faking.\nStay still. Breathe calmly and casually, like you normally would if you were really asleep or very relaxed. This way they'll think you're deeply sleeping and your body is working on getting you better from your \"sickness\".\nWhen you wake up from your \"sleeping\", remember to make sounds like you're sick and uncomfortable. Say something like \"ow\", which will definitely spark your parents' interest and they will likely ask, \"What's wrong?\" or think to themselves that you can't go to school on Monday.\n\n, Definitely don't do anything you enjoy doing, because not doing it will convince your parents that you're sick if you're turning down one of your favourite things\/hobbies to do. Also remember to work hard and go to a lot of trouble to fake your \"sickness\". Your parents will never suspect you of faking sickness if you go to a lot of trouble to convince them you're sick.\n\n, There are many dangers and cautions involving this. You should also remember that your parents might just have a trick up their sleeves to catch you out in the act of faking sickness. If you honestly are hungry, you should eat something when your parents aren't going to notice, but this is also a possible danger. Your parents could catch you eating when you have \"no appetite\".\n\n, While you are busy reading this, your parents might be reading about what kids do to fake sickness.\n\n, There are articles about doing that that could help you in achieving those things. To fake vomit, you could try chewing something, and bring it back up your throat when it's not too far down. Read the article on wikiHow about making fake diarrhea if you want to know how to do that.\n\n, Cough and say something to yourself like, \"I wish Mum and Dad were awake to help me\", right outside your parents' bedroom door, but as soon as they wake up quickly run to the bathroom or toilet and play the \"innocence act\". Act like nothing happened and you were just talking to yourself as you walked past their bedroom and that you didn't intend to wake them up.\n\n, Otherwise, if they notice that you are trying very hard to get the point across that you're \"sick\", they will begin to suspect that perhaps you're not sick after all. Just try hard enough for them to decide you're sick.\n\n, This way, they will think you're sick and won't take you to the doctor because you feel \"dizzy\" whenever you try to \"get up\".\n\n, During the night, while you know your parents are sleeping (and any other members of your family) quickly go to the bathroom tap or the kitchen tap and wet yourself. Dry yourself but make sure you remain cold enough to have goosebumps. Once you're certain you aren't wet but have goosebumps, go into your parents' room and complain that you're cold.\n\n, Then go to your parents' room again and complain of stomach, headache, fever or something like that. This will be your last shot at faking before the morning. Remember to keep up the masquerade in the morning as well. Wake up early deliberately to make it seem like you really do need the day off because you won't be focusing to your best at school due to going to bed late and waking up early. Act like it was your sickness that woke you up so early and kept you up so late.\n\n, Spend a fair amount of time in the toilet (with the door shut) and then flush. Make sure your parents don't see the toilet before you flush it, because they will detect no waste to be found in the toilet bowl.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":584}

{"text":" Before starting the job there is a number of required tools you must have. They're listed in the Things You'll Need section of this page. Most should be available with a basic garage tool set. If you don't have a specific one, most auto parts stores will allow you to rent one out by paying a deposit which is returned after the tool is.\n\n.\n, Now that you have all the tools to do the job you'll need to make sure it's done safely. Safety glasses, closed or steel toe shoes, working gloves and preferably pants are all recommended., Place chocks or a solid piece of wood behind either of the rear wheels to prevent the car from moving.\n\n, Loosen the front lug nuts using a breaker bar and a 19mm socket. Do not remove the lug nuts completely! A quarter of a turn in the counter clockwise direction should be enough.\n\nIf you have a wheel lock nut, always remove it first and install last!\n\n, This will unlock the wheel and keep your battery off.\n\nMake sure to roll down a window or keep a door open so you don't lock your keys in the car.\n\n, Place a small wooden board between the jack and the frame to prevent any damage. You don't have to worry about this if the lifting surface of your jack is rubber., Watch for any movement or slippage of the jack. If positioned properly it will lift the vehicle straight and directly upwards. If you see any tilt or slippage, stop immediately. Assess the situation and lower the car very slowly. Re-position the jack properly and repeat the lifting procedure., This should be enough the position the jack stands underneath the support location. It is identified by two cutouts in the pinch-weld of the car., Then lower the jack onto them until they touch. It is always a good idea to leave the jack just touching the lifting spot, it provides additional safety and saves time later on when lowering the car., Do this by giving the car a slight push down on the hood and sideways on the fender.\n\n, Turn the steering wheel in the direction such that it gives you better access to caliper bolts. (Working on the drivers side, turn the wheel to the left)., Using a ratcheting wrench and a 15mm socket. On this model they are integrated with caliper pins so put them on a rag to be cleaned and re-greased later. Notice that the pins are different. One of them has a rubber insert on it and that one always goes in the top caliper hole., Do this by tugging on it or placing a small pry bar between it and the rotor to pry it off. Use a rubber strap or a piece of wire to secure the rotor to the suspension spring. This will prevent any potential damage to the brake hose.\n\n\n\nIf the caliper pin bolts do not move and appear to be seized, stop immediately! Put the wheels back on and have an automotive shop perform the brake job. Removing seized caliper pins requires additional tools.\n\n, Using a 15mm socket. These may be very tight and it might be easier to loosen with a breaker bar. Remove the bolts and remove the caliper bracket. Use a small hammer to make the pads come out of the bracket. Although sometimes they can be removed by hand.\n\n, Do this by pulling and wiggling it side to side. If it is stuck use penetrating oil in the holes where the lug studs come out, let it rest for a few minutes. Proceed to tap the back of the rotor with a hammer while alternating sides to gradually remove it from the hub.\n\n, It does not have to be perfect, as long as major rust is removed.\n\n\nIf your pads came with hardware (metal shims) you can remove the old ones from the caliper bracket and use a wire brush to clean the rust off from underneath the old shims.\nIf you do not have new shims, do not remove the old ones. Just use the wire brush to clean the rust off from the top of the old shims.\n\n,, You will notice it is oily. This is done by the manufacturer to prevent corrosion while storing and transporting parts. This oil film needs to be removed by spraying all rotor surfaces with brake parts cleaner. Be very careful using this spray since it is a strong irritant to the eyes and skin. Always use protective eye-ware and gloves.\n\n\nBrake parts cleaner usually dries and evaporates pretty quickly but if it does not just wipe it off with a clean rag. It is always a good idea to compare the new rotor to the old one and verify they are the same size.\n\n, Take one of the lug nuts and thread it on any stud by hand as far as it will go. This will make the rotor stay in place and ease the rest of the installation.\n\n, Your caliper bracket should be free of rust on the shim surface at this point. If you removed the old shims, install the new ones now. A good set of brake pads usually comes with a small packet of high temperature brake grease. Apply a very small amount of grease onto the shim surfaces as shown in the picture.\n\n\nManufacturer calls to put thread locking compound onto the caliper bolts.\n\n, Torque the bolts to 133 lb.ft (180 N.m).\n\n, If you look closely you may notice the brake pads are not the same. Two of them should be with small tabs on them and two without. The pad with a small tab goes on the inside surface of the rotor.\n\n, This might be a little tricky. Install the far part of the pad first and gently push in the middle of the pad. It should slide right in. Do the same on the outer side of the caliper bracket.\n\n, In order to do this you need to compress the piston first. It is recommended that you open the bleeder and let the fluid drain out into the drain pan below. Use a 10mm wrench to brake loose the bleeder. Do not use excessive force. If the bleeder does not come loose, stop immediately! Breaking the bleeder will render the caliper unusable and you will have to purchase a new one. If the bleeder does not come lose, open the hood of the car and remove the cap from the brake fluid reservoir, this will release pressure as the caliper piston is being compressed., Position the large C-clamp on the caliper as shown in the picture below. Begin to turn the handle of the C-clamp to compress the piston until it is flush with the surface of the caliper. If the piston is very hard to move, your caliper might be seized and will have to be replaced.\n\n, Discard the old brake pad., Failure to perform this step correctly will cause your brake pedal to be very soft and may become a safety issue.\n\n\nEnsure that the pin boots are not folded over and are positioned in the way that the pins will fit in them.\n\n, Remember that the pin with a rubber insert goes in the top hole and through the rubber pin boot. Tighten the bolts and torque them to 70 lb.ft (95 N.m).\n\nRemove the lug nut supporting the rotor on the hub.\n\n, Afterwards replace the cap of the brake fluid reservoir., Put the wheels back on the studs and hand tighten the lug nuts. Remember to keep the wheel flush on the surface of the rotor. Tighten the lug nuts as much as you can by holding the wheel with your free hand., Stop lowering immediately after the wheels make contact with the ground. There should be minimal weight on the wheels. Just enough to prevent them from moving., If you have a locking nut make sure to install it last and never toque it; just hand tighten. A good way to retain the star pattern and make the locking nut last to be tightened is to start torquing the lug nut directly opposite of the locking nut.\n\n, It is a good idea to check or remove all the tools and old parts from underneath the car before lowering it., Repeat this 3-4 times or until the pedal gets stiff.,, Make sure everything is working properly and that there is no abnormal noise. Brand new brake pads might cause a slight hissing noise upon braking. You may also notice a strange smell after driving. This is all normal and should only last one or two days. Follow brake pad manufacturer recommendation on break in procedure.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":589}

{"text":" Vanilla orchids require a tropical environment, so you will need sunlight, heat, space and humidity for it to grow. If you live in the South of the United States, Australia or another warm climate you may be able to cultivate vanilla outside.\n\n\nYour environment should be 65 degrees (18 Celsius) or warmer all year to successfully cultivate an orchid. Warmer temperatures are preferable.;\n, You can improve the greenhouse conditions until they are ideal for this type of orchid that requires heat, humidity and partial shade.\n\n, If you don\u2019t have a local florist or garden center that sells these, you may need to order them online.

Notice which end is the top and which is the bottom.\n\nAdd a pinch of liquid fertilizer to improve results.\nThe top is the direction in which the plant has been growing. The leaves will point down toward the bottom of the cutting., It will need shade 50 percent of the time, as well as constant support to grow vines. If you are using a trellis, you will need to create a shaded area above the plant.\n\n, Lay the bottom two nodes of the plant horizontally on the top of the soil. Nodes are vine intersections.\n\n\nOrchid soil is usually a combination of pine bark, perlite and mulch.\n\n,, It must be trained to grow vertically. You can purchase ties or clips online or at a gardening store.\n\n,, Never allow the soil to dry out, yet don\u2019t allow it to get too saturated or it can rot.\n\n, The mulch is its food so it should be rich in organic matter.\n\n,, Air roots will attach upward to the support and others will reach down to the soil. It will take between two and seven years for the plant to grow large enough to bloom.\n\n, It will encourage roots to grow and the plant to grow larger., It only flowers for a six week period per year and the flowers only last approximately one day.During this time, you will need to hand pollinate the flower in order to grow the vanilla beans.\n\n, Consider asking a local orchid grower to help you hand-pollinate the first few times.

{"text":" By regulating his feeding, sleeping, playing, and bathroom schedule, you help him fit comfortably into your life. The routine will bring him comfort, and you\u2019ll have fewer \u201caccidents\u201d down the road.;\n, After that, they should get 2-3 meals a day until they reach adulthood. Feed your puppy the amount recommended on the label. Many labels give only the total amount a dog should eat during the day. You\u2019ll need to divide those amounts into portions throughout the day.\n\n\nTo ensure the puppy grows well, feed him in meals instead of leaving food out at all times. If he doesn't finish his food within 15 minutes, pick up and remove the rest.\nVery small breeds often get low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). They should be fed four smaller meals spaced out to make sure their sugar levels are healthy throughout the day.\n\n, He'll need a few weeks to adjust to the schedule, so expect accidents at first. But as the puppy grows up, he'll be able to go for longer periods between bathroom sessions.\n\n\nPuppies 6-8 weeks old need to use the bathroom every hour during the day until they're housebroken. At night, you should let them out every 2-4 hours.\nPuppies 8-16 weeks old should be able to hold it for about two hours during the day and four hours at night.\n\n, Even when they're as young as eight weeks old, some puppies will sleep for a full eight hours during the night. Most, though, will need to use the bathroom at least once during the night. Do this 2-4 hours after putting your dog to bed.\n\n\nIt\u2019s best to let the dog out every two hours the first night or two, just in case.\nBegin increasing the time between wake-ups from every two hours to every four hours over several days or weeks. This will depend on the breed and how much your puppy sleeps. \u2014 Use your discretion.\nDaytime napping is important for puppies, but if you let him nap all day, he won't sleep at night!\n\n, During play, he'll learn that he's not allowed to bite or scratch, while working off his meals and growing strong and healthy. It also wears him out so he won't have excess energy that keeps him awake during scheduled nap or sleep times. A regular play schedule will keep him on his sleep schedule.\n\n\nTraining sessions should be fun enough for the puppy to count as play-time!\nKeep your puppy safe while he plays. Help him avoid things like falling, getting stuck, or eating\/chewing on things he shouldn\u2019t.\n\n, Crate training is the first step in potty training. Choose a crate with enough room for your dog to turn around comfortably. However, it shouldn't have so much room that he could use the bathroom in one corner and sleep in another. If your puppy learns to associate his crate with using the bathroom, he'll resist going into the crate to lay or sleep.\n\n\nIn the first few weeks, expect accidents in the crate even if it's the right size for the puppy. Don't lose your patience, though! He's still learning.\nIf your puppy is a larger breed, consider buying a crate with adjustable barriers that can be removed as the dog grows.\n\n, The den or family room is a good location for crate training. Leave the crate door open so the puppy can explore it at his own pace, and treat him whenever he goes into the crate.\n\n\nAfter he's grown used to the crate, start closing the door and leaving him in it for longer periods of time. Crate him at night and anytime you aren\u2019t home or able to watch him.\nYou can move the crate between rooms, bringing it into the bedroom with you at night, for example. But always make sure it's somewhere your dog feels safe.\n\n, If he associates going to the bathroom with a very specific place, he'll be less likely to have accidents in other places. It'll also make clean-up easier in the future because you'll know where he likes to go.\n\n, Minimize how much time he plays outside during the first 2-4 weeks of potty training. Playing with the dog outside in the middle of his potty training will confuse him about what he should do when he goes outside. When he's mastered potty-training, you can start spending more playtime outside with him.\n\n, \"Bathroom\" or \"Go potty\" are examples. When you take him outside, use that same phrase and the same tone of voice every time he goes to the bathroom. If your puppy uses the bathroom after you give the command, praise him with a lot of excitement and a treat.\n\n\nYou might also choose a separate command specific to encouraging your dog to defecate. Young puppies need to defecate more often, so teaching a dog to associate a specific command with defecating can be useful.\n\n, This isn't a punishment, but a training tool. If your puppy doesn\u2019t use the bathroom within a few minutes of you giving the command, put him in his crate for 5-10 minutes. The dog may whine or cry when confined to the crate, but don\u2019t let them out.\u2013It will confuse the learning process.\n\n\nAfter 5-10 minutes have passed, take him back outside to use the bathroom and give the command again.\nRepeat the process until he makes an attempt to use the bathroom after you give the command.\nWhen he finally uses the bathroom, repeat the command and reward him with lots of praise and a treat, then let him back into the house to play.\n\n, Hang the bell by the door you use each time you take the dog out. It should hang low enough for your puppy to reach with his paw or nose. Use the bell only with a single door at first. You can move the bell or add more bells at other doors once the puppy understands how the bell system works.\n\n\nVery small breed dogs and very young puppies may not be able to hold it long enough to reach the door that leads outside. In that case, hang the bell wherever the dog spends the most time \u2014 the living room, for example. You can move the bell to the outside door when the puppy can hold it a little longer.\nIt helps to keep the dog\u2019s living area small during the stage until potty training is well established. You might use a puppy gate and attach a bell to it.\n\n, Hold out treats near the bell, and ring it when the dog comes to retrieve the treats. You might smear a little cheese or some other treat on the bell, and, when the dog touches the bell, reward him with an additional treat. Repeat this process until the dog knows to associate the bell with reward.\n\n, Always open the door immediately after any hint of the bell ringing, and give lots of praise. There are a few different ways to train your puppy to ring the bell:\n\n\nWithout ringing the bell yourself, tap your fingers on the wall or door next to it, and say \"Outside.\" Your puppy should learn to jump up to your fingers, ringing the bell in the process.\nHold a treat just behind the bell, and say \"Outside.\" The puppy\u2019s nose will ring the bell when he goes for the treat.\nPhysically take your puppy\u2019s paw, hit the bell with it, and say \"Outside.\"\nSkip the bell training if you\u2019re rushing out for a bathroom emergency. Only use the bell with scheduled bathroom breaks.\n\n, Your puppy is very smart, and has a great sense of cause and effect. Anything he observes before the door opening\/praise\/treat will be seen as a cause of the desired effect. If you let variation creep into what your dog experiences before the door opens, he can become confused. Make it easy for him to learn what he needs to do to be let out. Keep it simple. For example, only use one of the methods outlined in the previous step \u2014 don't mix and match.\n\n, You can either move the bell to different doors or hang a different bell by each exterior door. When you travel, take a bell with you so the dog can use it while on the road. Similarly, send the bell with your dog if he stays at another home while you\u2019re away on a trip. If you need to find a new home for your dog, let the new owners know he's bell trained, and encourage them to make a bell available at the new home.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":596}

If you don't have Jokers, instead designate a specific card the \"bonus card\" (usually Twos or \"one eyed Jacks\").\n\n\nThe Joker or bonus card is worth -2 (negative two) points instead of its usual value.\nA pair of Jokers or bonus cards cancel each other out just like normal pairs, increasing your score from -4 to 0.\n\n, This optional rule punishes players who try to end the game too early, and rewards players who correctly guess when they're ahead. Here are a couple variations.\n\n\nThe player who ends the game (by \"knocking\" or by flipping their last card face up) gains 10 points if they do not have the lowest score this round.\nIf the player who ended the game does not have the lowest score this round, that player gains a number of points equal to the player who did.\n\nFor example, Scrooge \"knocks\". After each player takes their final turn and counts up their score, Scrooge has 17 points and Marley has 12. Because Scrooge didn't win the round by getting the lowest score, Scrooge is punished for knocking and adds Marley's 12 points to his own. The final scores are Scrooge 29 and Marley 12.\n\n\n\n, Follow the rules for 6-card golf, but give each player a 4x2 or 5x2 grid.\n\n\nThis will make the game quite a bit longer and may require an additional deck of cards shuffled with the other(s).\n\n, Follow the rules for 4-card golf, but give each player a hand of four cards instead of a grid.\n\n\nPlayers can look at all cards in their hand at any time.\nAny two cards in hand cancel out if they have the same value. There is no \"grid position\" in your hand.\nThis creates a short simple game with no need to memorize cards.\n\n, Follow the rules for 6-card golf, but give each player a 3x3 grid.\n\n\nEach player turns up 3 cards instead of 2 at the start of the game.\nA player can only cancel cards by getting 3 of a kind in the same row or column. When they do, they can remove those 3 cards and place them at the bottom (NOT the top) of the discard pile.\nThis will make the game quite a bit longer and may require an additional deck of cards shuffled with the other(s).\n\n, There are many different ways to play 6-card golf, and different families and gaming groups will have their own rules. Here are some common ones:\n\n\nWhen you flip over your first two cards, they have to be in the same column, or they must be in different columns.Two of the same card anywhere on the layout cancel out, not just in the same column. This makes the game easier for younger players or beginners.If you have two columns next to each other with FOUR of the same card in them, they cancel out to zero points AND each other player gets 10 points added to their score this round.Players can only draw from the top of the draw pile during the final turns, not the discard pile.\n\n, Again, there are many ways to play. Here are some common additions or changes to the rules:\n\n\nYou can only peek at the two cards closest to you.\nPairs across from each other diagonally also cancel out.\nPairs don't cancel out at all. The only goal is to take the lowest cards and try to end the game when you think you're ahead.\nPlayers can only draw from the top of the draw pile during the final turns.\n\n, If you're playing a variation that allows you to start with face up cards, choose cards in different columns. This gives you more chances to \"cancel\" out a column.\n\n, Unless you can cancel out your high scoring cards, you want to get rid of them so they don't add their high values to your score.\n\n\nThis is especially important as the game draws to a close. If your opponent is almost out of face down cards (or is looking smug), toss out your liabilities as quickly as possible!\n\n, Much of the strategy in Golf comes down to paying attention to the other players.If the player to your right is picking up Sixes, you should give up trying to cancel your own Sixes. They aren't likely to discard any.\nIf the player to your left is trying to finish a column of Nines, try to avoid discarding your own Nine.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":599}

Lawyers rely on their clients to refer others, so this is a great way to find trustworthy lawyers.\nYou can get a referral to a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association.Call up the lawyer and ask to schedule a consultation. Also ask how much the consultation will cost.\n\n, Each state has a \u201cstatute of limitations,\u201d which is the maximum amount of time you get to bring a lawsuit. The amount of time will differ by state. It is incredibly important to recognize the time constraints and file before the statute of limitations expires. In your situation, because you are suing a parolee, you may be cutting it really close. In some circumstances, the statute of limitations may be tolled (i.e., suspended) for a period of time.\n\nFor example, in California, the statute of limitations might be tolled when a defendant is in prison. When the offender gets out of prison, the statute of limitations will begin to run again.\nTherefore, in a state like California, you may get longer than the normal two years to file your personal injury suit against the offender., Before suing, you should confirm that you actually have a legal case for assault. Assault is defined as someone intentionally creating a reasonable apprehension that you will suffer harmful or offensive contact.If someone raised their fist to strike you, then they probably have committed an assault\u2014provided you saw them make the action and felt in immediate danger of being punched.\n\n\nThe defendant doesn\u2019t need to actually touch you in order to assault you. It is the belief that you are about to be harmed that is the injury.\nHowever, assault cannot consist of only threatening words.Someone has not assaulted you by sending a Tweet that states \u201cI am going to punch you\u201d or by shouting at you that they want to hurt you.\nAlso consider your injury. You can sue for assault, even where you haven\u2019t suffered physical injury or emotional distress. However, you won\u2019t recover much money, which could make the entire lawsuit a waste of time.\n\n, In order to collect money damages in a suit against a parolee for injuries caused by them, you must have suffered some quantifiable harm. Work with your lawyer to determine how much this might be. In general, the court will award damages for economic harm and non-economic harm.\n\nEconomic damages are verifiable losses for things like medical expenses, property damages, and lost earnings. These damages can usually be determined by using receipts and bills.\nNon-economic damages are more subjective losses for things like pain and suffering, inconvenience, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment. These damages are usually calculated by multiplying your economic damages by a number between 1.5 and 5 depending on the severity of the harm., Punitive damages are meant to punish.Usually, they are awarded for intentional, highly-offensive conduct. Because assault is intentional, you might qualify for punitive damages.\n\n\nNot every state allows punitive damages, so you should specifically ask your lawyer if your state does.\n\n, You should also report the assault to the parolee\u2019s officer, since they need to know whether the parolee has violated the law. You can find a parole officer by calling the probation department in your county.\n\n\nThe police should also bring the assault to the attention of the prosecutor. If not, you should report the assault to the police if you haven\u2019t already done so.\n\n, Restitution is a court ordered penalty requiring the offender to pay you an amount of money that begins to cover your losses stemming from a crime. Restitution will generally cover medical and dental costs, mental health counseling, funeral costs, income loss, relocation expenses, security system expenses, attorney fees, and potential future losses.\n\nRestitution is set, by a judge, at the time the offender is sentenced., As soon as you can, contact the district attorney and ask whether restitution is available in your particular case. Chances are, if you suffered a financial harm as a direct result of the offender's assault, you will be eligible. DAs may even proactively send you restitution forms to fill out.\n\nThe DA often has a very short window to present your restitution case to the judge. Therefore, it is very important that you fill out forms and\/or talk to the DA as soon as possible after the offender is charged., The DA, during sentencing, will be asked to provide evidence of your injuries so a definite restitution amount can be determined by the court. Therefore, it is important that you hand over all the evidence you have about the injuries you sustained and the financial harm it cost you. This paperwork will be the same type of paperwork that you have been collecting for your civil case. For example, you should gather and hand over the following types of documents:Bills (hospital, dental, funeral, etc.)\nReceipts\nExpenses\nInsurance information\n\n, Once the judge imposes restitution on the offender, your state's department of corrections, and potentially other agencies, will help you collect. While the offender is in prison, money will be taken out of their trust account as it comes in. Generally, the corrections department will be able to take up to 50% of the money offenders receive. That money will then be transferred to you.\n\nOnce the offender leaves prison, your information is automatically forwarded to your state's taxing agency. That agency will work to collect on your behalf through the use of wage garnishments, bank liens, and payment plans.\nIf you are not getting paid, you can file a civil lawsuit and, as a part of your larger case, ask the court to submit a court order requiring the offender to pay.\nRestitution orders will never expire, even if the offender files for bankruptcy, so you can continue to collect until you have been paid in full., You can\u2019t just sue someone anywhere. Instead, you can typically sue them in the county where they live. This may be the same county that you live in.\n\n\nIf the parolee lives in a distant county or in another state, then you need to consider this fact as part of your calculation as to whether you should sue. Talk about it with your lawyer.\nAlso think about whether you want to sue in small claims court. These courts are set up so that people can bring lawsuits without a lawyer\u2019s help. Generally, there is a maximum amount you can sue for in small claims court.Check with the court clerk.\n\n, You start a lawsuit by filing a \u201ccomplaint\u201d in court. This document identifies you as the person suing (the \u201cplaintiff\u201d) and the person who assaulted you as the \u201cdefendant.\u201d In many courts, there are printed, \u201cfill in the blank\u201d complaint forms you can use. Check the court\u2019s website or with the clerk. Your complaint should contain the following:\n\n\nA description of the factual circumstances surrounding the assault.Make sure to mention the elements of assault\u2014that the defendant\u2019s action was intended to create a reasonable apprehension of harmful or offensive contact.A claim that the assault injured you in some way. The apprehension of offensive or harmful contact is itself an injury, but mention all injuries, including emotional distress.\nA request for money compensation, including punitive damages if they are available.\nWhether you want a jury (available in some small claims courts).\nYour signature.\n\n, When you finish the complaint, make a copy for your records. Then take the completed complaint and your copies to the court clerk. Ask to file the original. Depending on your court, you may need to file copies as well.\n\n\nYou probably have to pay a filing fee. Ask the clerk for the amount and what methods of payment are acceptable.\nIf you can\u2019t afford the filing fee, ask for a fee waiver.\n\n, You have to give the defendant a chance to respond to your complaint. For this reason, you need to send them a copy of your complaint and a \u201csummons,\u201d which you can get from the court clerk.You generally can make service in one of the following ways:\n\n\nPay the sheriff or constable to make hand delivery on the defendant.\nHire a private process server to make hand delivery. You can find process servers listed in your phone book or online.\nHave someone 18 or older make hand delivery, provided they are not a party to the lawsuit.\nMail the complaint certified mail, return receipt requested. You can often mail the complaint if you sue in small claims court.\n\n, The defendant will probably file an \u201canswer.\u201d In this document, they will respond to each allegation that you made in your complaint.You should read the answer closely.\n\n\nThe defendant might file a \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d instead. This document is a little different from an answer. Usually, a defendant will bring a motion to dismiss if you sued in the wrong court or didn\u2019t allege all of the elements of assault. There may be other reasons.If you receive a motion to dismiss and don\u2019t understand it, meet quickly with your attorney.\n\n, The defendant might not even respond to the lawsuit or might respond after the deadline. In either situation, you might be able to get a default judgment.Once you have a default judgment, you can try to get compensated for your injury.\n\n\nSee File a Motion for Default Judgment for additional information.\n\n, If you receive a response from the parolee, they will likely be contesting your petition. At this stage of the action, you will take part in discovery, which allows both sides to collect and exchange information in order to prepare for trial. During discovery you will collect facts, interview witnesses, find out what the other side is going to say, and figure out how strong your case is. In order to achieve these things, you will be able to use the following tools:Depositions, which are formal, in person interviews with parties and witnesses conducted under oath. The answers given can be used in court.\nInterrogatories, which are formal questions, posed in writing, that parties and witnesses are required to answer. The answers given can be used in court.\nRequests for documents, which are written requests asking the other party to give you certain documents. You might ask for things like text messages, email exchanges, and pictures.\nRequests for admission, which are written statements the other party is required to admit or deny. These statements help narrow the focus of litigation and determine what the true issues are.\n\n, When discovery concludes, the defendant is likely going to try and end the litigation by filing a motion for summary judgment. If successful, the judge will stop the case and immediately rule in the defendant's favor. To succeed, the defendant will have to persuade the judge that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the judge will rule in the defendant's favor, if, even if the judge makes every factual assumption in your favor, you would still lose.\n\nYou can defend against this motion by filing a response. Your response will include specific affidavits and pieces of evidence that tend to prove that factual disputes do exist. If you succeed, the litigation will continue., If you successfully defend yourself at the summary judgment stage, you should discuss a settlement with the defendant. Trials are incredibly expensive and time consuming and settling is a great way to avoid that. Ask the defendant to sit down with your lawyer and discuss a way to come to an agreement. If informal discussion fail, you might need to take part in some other alternative dispute resolution program.\n\nFor example, you might ask the defendant to take part in mediation. During mediation, a neutral third party will sit down with you and the defendant to discuss unique ways to settle the case. The mediator will not take sides and will not inject their own opinions.\nIf mediation fails, try non-binding arbitration. During arbitration, a judge-like third party will hear both sides of the case. After evidence has been presented, the arbitrator will draft a written opinion stating who they think should win, and how much they should be awarded.\n\n, As you approach trial, you should pull your evidence together. Identify the witnesses who you want to call, if any. Also get copies of documents you want to introduce. For example, if you have medical records, then you will want to introduce those into evidence.\n\n\nYour witnesses must have personal knowledge of what they are testifying about.For example, a witness who saw the defendant throw a punch at you can testify as to what they saw. However, the witness can\u2019t testify to gossip.\nYou will likely have to turn over a copy of all documents you intend to use as exhibits. You can make an exhibit by attaching an exhibit sticker to a corner of the document.\n\n, It is perfectly normal to be nervous about what will happen at trial. Ideally, you can prepare by sitting in on one. Check the court\u2019s calendar to see when a trial is being held. Make note of where the parties sit and how they talk to witnesses and the judge.\n\n, Right before the trial begins, you will be required to attend one final pretrial conference with the judge and defendant. During this conference, the judge will set the trial schedule, which includes what matters can be heard. It is your responsibility to tell the judge everything you plan on saying during trial. If you fail to do so, the judge may leave an important issue off of the trial schedule, which means you may not be able to bring it up., If you requested a jury, then you will pick the jury first. Then you will present your evidence to show that the defendant assaulted you. You can call your witnesses and testify on your own behalf.The defendant will get a chance to cross-examine all of your witnesses.\nAs you testify on cross-examination, remember to listen closely to the question asked and request clarification if necessary. Always remember to tell the truth., The defendant gets to present evidence second. Typically, you can ask every witness questions on cross-examination if you think it would be helpful.See Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself for more information.\n\n, If you had a jury, the judge will read the jury its instructions and then let them retire to deliberate.If you don\u2019t have a jury, then the judge should deliver a verdict from the bench.\n\n, Your work doesn\u2019t end with the verdict. If you win the lawsuit, you face the task of recovering monetary compensation from the defendant. Ideally, the defendant will just pay up. However, if they don\u2019t, then you might need to take other actions.\n\n\nIf you lost the lawsuit, you might want to consider filing an appeal.You start the appeal process by filing a Notice of Appeal with the trial court. You typically don\u2019t get much time\u2014usually 30 days or less after the verdict becomes final. You should talk with a lawyer about whether it is worthwhile to take an appeal.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":604}

E.g., 95, 23, 54, and 33 are written \"nittiofem\", \"tjugotre\" (\"twenty\"=\"tjugo\" and \"three\"=\"tre\"), \"femtiofyra\" (\"fifty\"=\"femtio\" and \"four\"=\"fyra\") and \"trettiotre\" (\"thirty\"=\"trettio\" and \"three\"=\"tre\").\n\n, 100 is said \"hundra\" (pronunciation: h\u0275ndra), 1000 is \"tusen\" (pronunciation: t\u0289\u02d0s\u025bn) and 10000 is \"tiotusen\" (see pronunciation for \"tio\", ten, and \"tusen\", thousand). It is quite easy; you just add the larger number before the rest, as in English. If there is not just one larger number, such as 2000, then you add that number first, as in English. The same applies if there are many \"huge numbers\". You do never say \"och\" (\"and\") between the numbers, and you never put a \"-\" there either. If you want to say 3502, then you say \"tretusenfemhundratv\u00e5\" (if you have trouble reading it, then try this: \"tre-tusen-fem-hundra-tv\u00e5\", \"three-thousand-five-hundred-two\"; however, you should not write with \"-\"-marks).\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":606}
{"text":" Black and brown are the most popular neutral colors. You can also try nude\/tan, white, and gray as well. Silver and gold are also both considered to be neutral, and are ideal for evening looks.\n\n\nPlan ahead. Avoid mixing contrasting colors, such as black booties and a white dress. This will \"cut\" your legs in half, and make them appear too short.;\n, The more slender your heel is, the more chic and sophisticated your outfit will look. A sleek, slender heel is also ideal if you want a more dressy look.\n\n, Shiny materials make things look bigger. Matte materials, such as leather, suede, or canvas, make things appear smaller., Ideally, the cuff of the boot should extend just past the ankle as well.You might also want to skip excessive details, such as heavy embellishment or lots of straps. These will only add bulk to your boots, and thus to the ankle area., These styles tend to be more comfortable than ones with high heels and pointed toes, especially after hours of walking. They are ideal for casual, day-time looks., The pointed toes and higher heels automatically make these styles look fancier than their casual counterparts. They are feminine, and great for elongating the leg. They are ideal for date nights where you won't be doing a lot of walking., Depending on what body shape you have, different boot styles will help balance your body out. Listed below are some ideas based on the four main body types:If you have a pear-shaped body, your hips are wider than your shoulders. Opt for a simple pair of ankle boots with a heel.\nIf you have an inverted triangle shape, your shoulders are wider than your hips. Try a pair of brightly colored boots. Heavily-embellished styles will also work. This will give the illusion of curvier legs.\nIf you have a rectangle body shape, your hips, wait, and shoulders are the same size. Try a pair of detailed boots, as this will give the illusion of curves.\nIf you have an apple body shape, your widest point will be your waist or torso. Opt for a pair of brightly colored or heavily-embellished boots. This will draw the attention away from your waist, and give the illusion of curves.\n\n, Much like body type, different boot styles will help balance things out like height, curves, or lack of curves. Listed below are some ideas based on different height and size combinations:If you are short and slim, go for heeled boots that cover the ankle. This will make your legs appear longer. Avoid boots that end at or below the ankle.\n\n, This will extend your legs, and give you a longer, sleeker look.\n\n\nIf you are tall and curve, skip the cuff details. Too much detailing along the cuff will draw too much attention to your calves, and make them appear thicker than they actually are. Instead, opt for plain cuffs.\nIf you are tall and slender, you can go with any style of boot.\n\n, Anything that ends about mid-thigh would be idea. The shorter your dress is, the longer your legs will appear. Long dresses (knee-length and loner) are generally not recommended for ankle boots, as they tend to shorten the leg.\n\n\nIf you must wear a longer dress, consider wearing some opaque tights that match the color of your boot. The ideal combination is black boots and black tights. This will make your legs appear longer.\n\n, Long dresses are generally not recommended for booties, because they tend to make the legs appear too short. You can resolve this by getting a dress whose hem ends just above the boot. If you want to wear a maxi-length dress, try one with a slit up the side.Both of these tricks will help keep your legs from looking too short or stumpy.\n\n\nTry pairing longer dresses with fancier boots that have slimmer heels and toes. Casual boots, with wide cuffs and chunky heels will look better with shorter dresses., This will allow your accessories (such as wide belts and layered boho necklaces) really shine through without making your outfit appear too cramped. The dress can have a pattern on it, if you'd like, but tone down the embellishments, such as beading and embroidery.\n\n, Bulky, heavy boots will \"weigh\" the dress down. Some embellishments, such as a simple strap, won't take away from the look, however., Depending on what sort of dress your wear with your booties, you can draw the focus away from certain areas, and direct it to others. Here are some tips based on different body types:If you are short and slim, try bubble skirts, rompers, and mini dresses. To make your legs appear longer, wear some opaque tights that match the color of your boot.\nIf you are petite and curvy, try an A-line dress that ends just above the knee if you are petite and curve. Avoid wearing dresses that end below the knee, as this will make your legs appear shorter.\nIf you are tall and curvy, try a long tunic-type dress or a semi-voluminous dress with dark tights. This will help make your legs appear more slender.\nIf you are tall and slender, try a dress that ends just above the knee.\n\n, Not all boot styles go well with all dresses. Creating contrast between boot and dress styles can make a boring outfit look more interesting. The wrong type of contrast, however, can make your outfit look clashy, and not in a good way. For example, thick, chunky booties won't look good with a lacy evening dress.Here are a few tips to keep in mind when putting your outfit together:Pair boots with pointed toes and slender heels with fancier dresses. Pair boots with rounded toes and flat or chunky heels with casual dresses.\nTry sleek dresses with boots that have sleek heels. If your dress is simple, then you can go wild with the accessories.\nTry cowboy styled boots with high-waisted dresses for that vintage feel.\n\n, Note any details on your boots, such as studs or beaded trim. Choose accessories, such as belts or jewelry, that match these details. If your boots are plain, look at the style of your dress instead.\n\n\nIf you are wearing simple, leather boots and a boho styled dress, try adding a wide, leather belt, some feather earrings, and a rustic necklace made from natural stones.\nIf you are wearing a simple dress with leather, studded boots, try adding a matching, studded leather belt, and some silver jewelry.\nLeather ankle boots, a sleeveless tribal patterned midi, a long necklace, and a fedora all look fabulous for a boho look.\n\n, Something as simple as a matching jacket can make a flirty, girlish outfit look more formal and business like. For example, a fit and flare dress with slender-heeled booties will give you a flirty and girlish look. Adding a jacket and\/or belt over the dress will immediately give you a more businesslike look., If your boots already have a lot of zippers, studs, or straps, you might want to keep the rest of your outfit looking simple. This also includes your dress. Instead, try a simple belt, scarf, or a pair of stud earrings.If your accessories and dress are too detailed as well, your entire outfit will look too busy.\n\n, A simple dress and boots are like a blank canvas. Try adding some longer earrings and a statement necklace. You can also play around with other accessories, such as a belt, bag, and hat or scarf. Try not to go overboard with your accessories however; if you add too many, your outfit will appear too cluttered.\n\n, Black tights and black booties are great for making your legs appear longer, but they won't make your outfit look very interesting. Patterned tights, however, will.Make sure that your patterned tights match your outfit somehow. For example, if your dress has roses on it, try tights made from lace with a rose design. If your boots have a chevron print on the cuff, try tights with a chevron weave.\n\n, For a more chic look, try a slim belt over a plain sheath dress with slender-heeled boots.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":607}

Just go back to the beginning; tap the knuckle of your index finger again and say \u201cAugust.\u201d Continue from here to get to the rest of the months.\n\n, Here are some easy-to-remember Doomsdays: 4\/4, 8\/8, 10\/10, 12\/12, 5\/9, 9\/5, 7\/11, and 11\/7. A mnemonic for the last four Doomsdays in the list is: \u201c9 to 5 job at a 7-11 gas station.\u201d For example, in the year 2000, April 4, June 6, July 11, and November 7 are all Tuesdays. (Important note: this does not mean that April 4, 2001 was also Tuesday. April 4, 2001 was actually a Wednesday.) You can add or subtract 7 from any Doomsday to get another Doomsday. For example, 5\/9, 5\/16, and 5\/23 are all Doomsdays. You don\u2019t have to just add or subtract 7 at a time though; you can use any multiple of 7. For example, 9\/5 and 9\/26 are both Doomsdays, because 5+7*3 \u2261 26. Another easy-to-remember Doomsday is 3\/0. No this is not a typo; 3\/0 is simply another way of thinking about the last day of February. Unlike 2\/28 or 2\/29, 3\/0 is always the last day of February, regardless of whether or not it is a leap year. The world can even think of months as having negative days. For example, 8\/8 and 8\/-6 are both Doomsdays. To convert 8\/-6 into a normal date, simply add the number of days in the 7th month (August). Use the knuckle trick from the previous paragraph to determine that there are 31 days in August. So, 8\/-6 is the same as 7\/25, because -6+31 \u2261 25. We may also think of months as having days greater than 31. For example, 10\/10 and 10\/34 are both Doomsdays. To convert 10\/34 into a normal date, simply subtract the number of days in the 10th month (October). Our knuckles tell us that October has 31 days, so 10\/34 is 11\/3, because 34-31 \u2261 3. We can even write June days as March days. For example, 6\/6 and 6\/-64 are Doomsdays. May (month 5) has 31 days, so 6\/-64 \u2261 5\/-33. April (month 4) has 30 days, so 5\/-33 \u2261 4\/-3. March (month 3) has 31 days, so 4\/-3 \u2261 3\/28. Thus, June -64th is equivalent to March 28th, which is a Doomsday. Be careful to account for leap years when using these tricks to determine Doomsdays in January or February. For example, in ANY year, 3\/0 and 3\/-14 are both Doomsdays, but in a leap year February has 29 days, so 3\/-14 \u2261 2\/15, while in a normal year February has 28 days, so 3\/-14 \u2261 2\/14. Thus, February 15th is a Doomsday during leap years, but February 14th is a Doomsday during normal years. You have to be careful when going from March to January as well. Leap year: 3\/-42 \u2261 2\/-13 \u2261 1\/18; normal year: 3\/-42 \u2261 2\/-14 \u2261 1\/17.\n\n,\nSunday \u2261 NONEday \u2261 0\nMonday \u2261 ONEday \u2261 1\nTuesday \u2261 TWO\u2019Sday \u2261 2\nWednesday \u2261 THREE\u2019Sday \u2261 3 (lame, I know)\nThursday \u2261 FOUR\u2019Sday \u2261 4\nFriday \u2261 FIVEday \u2261 5\nSaturday \u2261 SIXAday \u2261 6\nSunday \u2261 SE\u2019ENday \u2261 7 (\u201cse\u2019en\u201d as in a contraction for \u201cseven\u201d that sounds like \u201csun\u201d)\nBecause there are seven days in a week, you can add or subtract any multiple of 7 at ANY point during ANY part of ANY day-of-the-week calculation. This is why Sunday is both 0 and 7. Monday could be thought of as -6, 8, 71, etc. Throughout the guide you will see (and have been seeing) congruence symbols, \u2261, rather than equals signs, =, because 71 does NOT equal 8, but they are equivalent for the purpose of determining the day of the week. While finding a day of the week we are only interested in the remainder when numbers are divided by 7. All of these congruence are thus \u201cmodulo 7,\u201d abbreviated \u201cmod 7.\u201d Numbers are congruent modulo 7 if their remainders are the same when they are divided by 7. This is equivalent to the earlier point that you can add or subtract multiples of 7 as you wish. For example, 1 \u2260 8, but 1 \u2261 8 (mod 7). More examples of the way in which modulo behave are -15 \u2261 -1 \u2261 6 (mod 7) and 4 \u2261 -3 \u2261 7004 (mod 7). The notation \u201c(mod 7)\u201d will be left off throughout the guide, because all congruences are assumed to be modulo 7.\nIf you know that August 8, 1953 is a Saturday, then you can quickly determine that August 4, 1953 is a Tuesday, because four days before SIXAday is TWO\u2019Sday. That is, 6-4 \u2261 2. Likewise, if you know that 9\/5\/1776 is a FOUR\u2019Sday, then you can quickly see that 9\/7\/1776 is a SIXAday, because 7-5 \u2261 2 and 4+2 \u2261 6. Remember that you can add or subtract any multiple of 7 to a Number-day. If you know that 10\/10\/-2543 is a SIXAday, then you can quickly determine that 10\/2\/-2543 is a FIVEday, because 2-10 \u2261 -8 \u2261 -8+7 \u2261 -1, and 6+(-1) \u2261 5. Once again, remember to watch out for leap years, like 18,400. If you know that 2\/28\/18,400 is a ONEday, then you can quickly determine that 3\/3\/18,400 is a FIVEday, because 2\/28\/18,400 \u2261 3\/-1\/18,400 and 3-(-1) \u2261 4 and 1+4 \u2261 5.\n\n, For example, every Doomsday in 2009 is a Saturday, so the Year-day of 2009 is Saturday. The \u201cCentury-day\u201d of any given century is the \u201cYear-day\u201d of the first year of the century. The \u201cCentury-year\u201d is the first year of any given century. The Year-day of 1900 is Wednesday, so the Century-day of the 1900s (i.e. the 20th century) is Wednesday. Also, 1900 is the Century-year of the 20th century. Note though, that the Century-year of the century that -1362 lies in (i.e. the -1300s or the 14th century B.C.E.) is -1400, NOT -1300, because -1400 comes before -1300. Remember also that -1400 is equivalent to 1401 B.C.E., NOT 1400 B.C.E.\n\n, These Year-days are called \u201cBig Tuesdays\u201d (just to help you remember them). Years that are divisible by 400 are called \u201cBig Tuesday-years,\u201d and centuries that have Century-days that are also Big Tuesdays are called \u201cBig Tuesday-centuries.\u201d Thus, the Year-day of 1600 is a Big Tuesday. The Century-days of the 2000s, the -4400s, and the 96,812,000s are all Big Tuesdays, the 2000s, the -4400s, and 96,812,000s are all Big Tuesday-centuries, and 2000, -4400, and 96,812,000 are all Big Tuesday-years.\n\n, Subtract 100 from the Century-year until you get to a Big Tuesday-year. Count how many times you subtracted 100. If you subtracted 100 once, then the Century-day is Sunday; if twice, then it\u2019s Friday; if thrice, then it\u2019s Wednesday; if four or more times, then you messed up, because one of every four Century-years is a Big Tuesday-year. For example, the Century-day of the 1800s is Friday, because you subtract 100 twice to get 1600, which is a Big Tuesday-year (because it\u2019s divisible by 400). The pattern looks like this: 1600 \u2261 TWO\u2019Sday \u2261 2, 1700 \u2261 SUNday \u2261 0, 1800 \u2261 FIVEday \u2261 5 \u2261 -2, 1900 \u2261 THREE\u2019Sday \u2261 3 \u2261 -4, 2000 \u2261 TWO\u2019Sday \u2261 2 \u2261 -5, and so on. Note that you can get from one Century-day day to the next by subtracting two from the initial Century-day. This only works when the larger of the two adjacent centuries is not a Big Tuesday-century. That\u2019s fine though, because you already know that the Century-day of every Big Tuesday-century is TWO\u2019Sday.\n\n, The \u201cDozen-day\u201d of any given year is the Year-day of the Dozen-year. The Dozen-day can be calculated by adding the Century-day to the result of the division by 12. For example, the Dozen-year of 1234 is 1224, because 1224-1200 \u2261 24 \u2261 12*2, and no larger years that are still less than or equal to 1234 yield a positive difference with 1200 that is divisible by 12. Since the Year-day of 1224 is Thursday, the Dozen-day of 1234 is also Thursday. Note that the Dozen-days for 1235, 1226, and 1229 are all Thursdays as well; while the Dozen-days for 1236 and 1238 are not the same (they are, in fact, Fridays). For another example, we can calculate the Dozen-day of -1713. We first need to find the Century-day of the -1700s. Since we must subtract 100 three times from -1700 to arrive at a Big Tuesday-year, the Century-day is THREE\u2019Sday. Next we must find the Dozen-year. Note that the Dozen-year is not -1712, but rather -1716, because -1716-(-1800) = 84 = 12*7. So, the Dozen-day of -1713 is 3+7 \u2261 3 \u2261 THREE\u2019Sday (since we can subtract 7 as we please).\n\n, The \u201cQuad-day\u201d of any given year is the Year-day of the Quad-year. For example, the Quad-year of 1620 is 1620; while that of 1643 is 1640. The Quad-days of 1640, 1641, 1642, and 1643 are all Wednesday; while the Quad-day of 1620 is Saturday. We can calculate the Quad-day as follows. If the given year is 1642, then the Dozen-year is 1636, because 1636-1600 \u2261 12*3. The Century-year, 1600, is a Big TWO\u2019Sday. 3+2 \u2261 5, so the Dozen-day of 1642 is FIVEday. Subtract 4 from the Quad-year, 1640, until you get to the Dozen-year. Multiply the number of times you subtracted 4 by -2, and add this result to the Dozen-day to get the Quad-day. In our example, 1640-4*1 \u2261 1636, 1*-2 \u2261 -2, and 5+(-2) \u2261 3, so the Quad-day of 1642 is Wednesday (as mentioned previously). Wednesday, is thus also the Year-day of 1640.\n\n, Add the result to the Quad-day to get the Year-day. In our example, 1642-1640 \u2261 2, and 2+THREE\u2019Sday \u2261 FIVEday, so the Year-day of 1642 is Friday.\n\n, For example, if the date were 9\/5\/1642, you would already know that it was a Friday. If the date were 6\/20\/1642, then you would subtract 7 days twice to discover that 6\/20\/1642 is the same day of the week as 6\/6\/1642, which is a known Doomsday. This means that 6\/20\/1642 is also a Doomsday, and is therefore a Friday.\n\n, We know 4\/4\/1642 is a Doomsday, so we add 14 days to discover that 4\/18\/1642 is a Doomsday. Now we know that 4\/18\/1642 is a FIVEday, so we simply add 2 days to find that 4\/20\/1642 is a SE\u2019ENday. Don\u2019t forget that the nearest known Doomsday may not be in the same month. For example, 3\/29\/1642 is closer to 4\/4\/1642 than to 3\/0\/1642. Since 4\/4\/1642 \u2261 4\/-3\/1642 \u2261 3\/28\/1642, we know that 3\/29\/1642 \u2261 FIVEday + 1 \u2261 SIXAday.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":609}

{"text":" You don't need to have the wigs or the rugs, though. If it is a hair salon, you only need the items for your hair. Since they are all gone, you may need to trade for them. Just yell out in Jamaa Township: \"Does anyone have any salon den items? If so, I'd love to trade for them!\" If all else fails, you don't need spa items. Use an inflatable pool (make it white, I use a white pig pool and it's awesome.) for a hot tub. If you are using the beach den skip this step because it already has a pool. You could use a mirror that you can find at Outback Imports as a substitute for a vanity. Get creative!;\n, You need it to look good so people don't leave. Try adding some plants music, wallpaper, flooring, and some sort of rug. Everything should match. It should be wide and spacious. If you don't have a big enough den to fit all of your decorations in, you could use multiple small dens, but that would require a LOT of switching dens, so that isn't recommended. Nice music attracts customers and keeps them occupied in the waiting room, more about that on step 4. Wallpapers with different colors, like the pink striped wallpaper, look good. Avoid the rainbow wallpaper. Stick with wooden floors (beta wooden floor, wooden tiles, and wooden planks that come with the small den.) and don't have anything crazy, so avoid the grass floor.\n\n, You can add them in and tell customers to take one after they leave your salon! Like in step 1, it's a spa item, so you may need to trade for it. You could buy a fancy coffee table from Epic Wonders and put some books on it (or put a bookshelf next to it.), but you may need to trade for the books too. You may need to advertise your salon too, so that's why the customers need the magazines.\n\n, Add couches and things to play with so your customers don't get bored and leave your salon. If you are using a separate den for the waiting room, be sure that there is a bunch of stations in the actual salon, because people will get annoyed going back and forth from one den to another. You should have nice music in the waiting room den to keep customers happy.\n\n, You could also hire someone to greet the customers when they come in. If you'd like, add a welcome mat to the front. If you have a door in the front, make sure to open it so people can come in. If you have a greeter, be sure to check on them once in a while. If the greeter has to get off, put some couches next to the entrance so people cat sit while they wait to come in., Just say \"Ok\" and politely tell them to leave. If they don't leave, tell them you are going to lock them out and lock them out. Before you let everyone in, buddy them so you don't have to do it when you lock them out, or else it might just be an awkward moment of silence. It is also important to because they might report you while everyone is buddying you., If they don't, then lock them out or report them. If other people get jealous and go to the front of the line, lock them out too. Tell the remaining customers that everyone should not cut to the front of the line and wait politely. DO NOT TYPE LIKE THIS!! IT WILL GET CUSTOMERS MAD AND THEY WILL REPORT YOU!!!, Try and have a nice conversation with the \"nice\" customers. Who knows, you may host the salon lonely and come out being popular with your buddy list full!, You get tips by being nice to customers, providing a wide variety of services, and having your salon in tip-top shape, like in the step above. Don't be greedy and ask for tips, because it gives you a bad reputation. People in Animal Jam usually have a bad temper, so you could easily start a huge fight and all your customers will be yelling at you!, If they say no, kindly warn them they will be locked out and reported. If they stop, don't do it. If they do, then lock them out or report hem., If they ask for something that you don't provide, kindly tell them you don't provide it. If they yell at you or lose their temper, block 'em and lock 'em. If they ask for something you do provide (for example: the full treatment) then do the full treatment., Make sure to rinse it out and let it dry. Then brush their fur to rid it of any ratty areas. If they want, do their hair. Keep some hairspray by., They will most likely change their fur color. Ask them what color they want. If they reply saying \"This is the wrong color!\" or \"It's ruined!\" ask them specifically what color they want (for example: the purple on the top left) and you should be able to know what color they want. If they like it, then smile and compliment them by saying \"That color looks good on you!\" or \"You look stunning!\"., If they are a member, gift it to them. If they are a nonmember, ask if they can put something on trade and trade it to them. What accessories do they want? Ask them. It's always nice to get things, but it's even nicer to give things. If they want a head flower, give them a head flower that looks good with their outfit. Before you give it to them, put it on your animal and ask them \"Do you want this?\" just to make sure. If not, recycle it and get something they'd like. If they do, give it to them and compliment them by saying \"That really matches!\" or \"That looks good with your dress!\", Ask them which color they want and start painting. If they want a pattern, pretend to go get nail stencils ans ask them what color they want their pattern to be. Get that color and do your magic! Do a special marble effect, add cute little nail decals, and cut their nails! They'll adore their new fancy nails., Ask them which color and then apply the makeup on them. Do they want lipstick, mascara, or eye shadow? Do they want green contacts to match their green nails? Do it for them! For the girly girl, pink shades are their best friend. If your customer isn't the \"girly girl\" type, some blues, greens, or browns would look great on them. Be sure to avoid turning your customer into a clown- remember, not too much makeup! Ask them what makeup they can wear to make sure they aren't allergic to what you are using., Welcome them in your salon. Then let the look around top see the things they can do. Offer them some jobs that they might like doing. They will say something from the list down below:\n\nGreeting the customers sounds fun!\nI'd love to advertise your salon and give away magazines!\nEntertaining people in the waiting room suits me.\n\n, Tell them the things from \"Operating the Salon\" above. Check on them every once in a while to make sure they are doing their job. If they are doing it correctly, everyone should be happy and satisfied! Be sure to share your earnings with the employees so they don't quit., Give them breaks and let them chat for a while when they are not needed (for example: nobody is coming to the salon so the greeter doesn't need to greet people.). Provide food for the employees when they are on their break., Add some pizazz in and say \"Salon my den! It's epic!\". Just adding \"It's epic!\" makes jammers think it really is. Add things like \"It's huge\", \"It's about to get full\", \"Hurry before I leave\", \"Very spacious\", and \"It has good reviews\". Just remember whatever you say, people believe you. Ever wonder why people get scammed? It's because they believe what people say!, That's one of the worst and most annoying problems in Animal Jam. Why? Because most of the time, people who lock their den are trolling other people to click on their name tag for nothing. Make sure to keep your den unlocked so nobody thinks you are trolling them., That's also very annoying. Why? Same as above! You see an awesome salon being advertised, but the person advertising it is moving around like crazy or their name tag is covered by the crowds of Jamaa, so either way, you can't click! So annoying..., Your den will most likely be full. But, it may be super laggy and hard to type and hard for people to click your name tag. Instead of going into a full world, go into a world that has 3 green dots or 2 green dots. A better way to solve this is to go from world to world gathering jammers. Since spas are so rare in AJ, your den should be full in a few minutes (if people don't keep leaving, darn jammers!).","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":612}

After you've successfully completed a couple of drawings, you may want to expand, although you're be perfectly able to get by with the following:\n\n\nWood burning pen. These basically come in two varieties: the 'every-man's' soldering iron style machine with one heat setting as well as interchangeable brass tips, and the higher-end wire pen with two styluses and different heat settings. You can get a decent soldering iron style pen for $20+, while the more versatile wire pens sell for hundreds of dollars.Assorted wood burning tips. These will allow you greater leeway to produce lighter\/heavier marks, as well as different patterns.\nStrop and aluminum oxide to periodically clean off the brass tips of the wood burning pen.\nPliers.\nClay pot or pen holder (for safety when element is still hot).;\n, The hardness of wood is rated on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being the softest wood (like Balsa) and 10 being the hardest (like Padauk). For beginners, especially, the softer the wood, the better. Hard woods are expensive, resistant to heat, and generally on the darker side. Soft woods, on the other hand, are cheaper, easier to burn, and lighter, providing a good burn contrast. Try getting your hands on these soft woods as you start off wood burning:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPine\nBasswood\nBirch\nAsh\nMaple\n\n, Your pen will get quite hot quite fast, so attach the tip you'll be working with before you turn on the machine. Always attach and detach tips with your pliers. Give your pen two or so minutes to get hot. As it heats up, let your wood burning pen rest in a pen holding device or a clay pot to minimize the risk of accidental burning.\n\n, Take some 320 grit sandpaper, wrap it around a flat wooden block or attach to a paddle sander, and lightly hit all areas of the wood equally. Details will come out sharper and crisper when the surface of the wood is very smooth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen sanding, sand with the grain. The grain is the direction of the wood fibers. Sanding with the grain will minimize any tiny burrs or scratch marks that result from sanding against the grain.\nWhen you're done sanding, wipe the surface with a damp towel. This will remove any sawdust and make the outline transfer easier.\n\n, Many beginners make the mistake of pressing down too hard on the wood with the pen, thinking that lots of pressure is needed to make an impression. It's not. In fact, using light strokes is preferable to pressing down hard. It's easier to guide the pen, reduces errors, and all but eliminates the possibility of accidental burning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You're not going to win any awards for racing through the design in record time. Wood burning, regardless of the material you're using, is a slow process. As you familiarize yourself with the pen, remember:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteady pressure is best. For most beginner designs, you'll want the indents etched by the pen to be even all around.\nThe longer you hold your pen in one area, the darker and deeper it will get.\n\n, Turn your piece of wood until most of the grain is pointing downward. This will make your job much easier, as you will be moving your pen in a downward direction most of the time, thereby burning with the grain. Burning against the grain will offer up more resistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Once you have got your materials and you know the basics, get several pieces of practice wood and practice with the various tips that will come with your wood burner. Once you have a good idea of what each tip does, then you will know which ones to use for various projects. The tips you will use will depend upon what type of picture and how much detail you are going to put in the picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, If you are a killer artist and drawing is your thing, you may find it fun to draw directly onto the wood you're using with a graphite pencil. It's not the easiest, most efficient way of getting down an outline, but it sidesteps the lifeless, cookie-cutter stiffness that many artists unwittingly produce when copying directly from another image.\n\n, Make or print out a sketch of your image. Place the graphite paper, face down, on top of the wood, secure it to the wood with a bit of masking tape, and your sketch on top of the graphite paper. Then with a 2B pencil, trace over the sketch with medium pressure and fluid lines. Remove the graphite paper and deepen the outline on the wood with the same 2B pencil.\n\n, A transfer tip is a flat tip that uses heat to transfer the ink of a printed image directly onto the wood. Scan or find an imagine online that you'd like to use. Print out the image, preferably with a laser printer. Next, fasten the printed image to your wood with a clamp and begin to head up the transfer tip. Slowly, methodically, brush the back side of the paper \u2014 above where any ink is \u2014 with the transfer tip. Remove the paper and inspect your newly-transferred design.\n\n, This only takes a second, and should be done often. If you're hunched over and burning perilously close to your belly, chances are it's going to be much harder to burn.\n\n, This way, if you mess up, your flaw won't be pointing you straight in the face. Rest assured though \u2014 you can correct most mistakes by simply sanding them out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Remember, easy does it. You only want to apply light pressure so that you can stay nimble with your pen. Try to move the pen towards you, not away from you, as you begin to burn, with your wrist resting on the wood if possible.\n\n, Burn over the outlines of your design first to get them set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, If you want to try to make a wood burn image 3D instead of the customary 2D, you'll want to experiment with different tips \u2014 tips that express shades and textures. As always, a few hours of practice on the back of a scrap piece of wood will be invaluable when it comes to shading on the real deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You are now ready to start adding color to your image. Color is optional and may look better on some images then on others. You will want to use water colors and a brush of your choice. (Watercolors pencils work especially well.)\n\n, You can run your tips over a sanding block for a quick fix, or you can clean your (cooled off) tips on a strop using aluminum oxide. This removes excess carbon that sticks to the tips.Submerge your tips in cold water for a minute or two before touching if you're unsure how hot they are. Remember to use your pliers to safely detach any and all tips.\n\n, Some woods give off more smoke than others, smoke which can be breathed in and become irritating to your lungs. To counteract this, put on a fan if you're working in an enclosed area.\n\n, The last step is to put a wood finisher on your product. Let this dry thoroughly before your wood burning project is completely finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":614}
{"text":" Some of these basics might include black trousers or slacks, a solid-colored skirt, a dark blazer or jacket or a white button-down shirt. When in doubt about your outfit, incorporating one or more of these professional basics will polish your look.;\n, Keep ear piercings simple, take out any facial or tongue piercings and cover tattoos with long sleeves or pants when you're dressing for work in human resources\n\n, Remember that you're representing your company and keep your makeup understated and attractive. Your makeup can be unique as long as it's still professional. If you want to add more color, try adding it in moderation, like wearing colorful eyeshadow but skipping the bold lipstick.\n\n, Avoid skirts with high slits or shirts with see-through material, as these might show too much skin or be too provocative for the workplace.\n\n, A meeting with high-level international executives probably calls for a suit and jewelry, whereas a meeting with a small, grassroots or nonprofit group would allow you to dress more business casual.\n\n, Being familiar with the expected dress code will help you choose clothing that meets your company's expectations for employee appearance.\n\n, It's better to be a little overdressed or look more professional than necessary than to look overly casual or unprofessional.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":615}

{"text":" You can buy a plain one that is all one color. You can also buy a fancy one with a pattern on the cover.\n\n\nYou can also use a 2-ring binder if you can't find a 3-ring binder.;\n, Paper stains easily in the kitchen. A plastic page protector will keep your recipes clean. The smooth surface is also easy to wipe clean. They are transparent plastic sleeves, about same size as a sheet of printer paper. Most will already have holes punched in the sides for the binder rings to go through. You can find them at office supply stores, and well-stocked arts and crafts stores., You might already have some in your home. You can also find plenty of recipes online and in magazines. Lastly, you can also ask your friends and family members if they have any recipes they would like to share with you.\n\n, This will keep everything looking consistent. If you have beautiful handwriting, you can write the recipes out by hand instead. You can also use the original recipes if you don't care about consistency.\n\nAvoid adding page numbers if you plan on adding more recipes to the binder later.\nUse page numbers if you already have all the recipes you want and don't plan on adding anymore.\nIf the recipe is a long one, print it out on a single page. If you have a few recipes that are short and very similar, try putting them on the same page. You can divide them into paragraphs or columns., If you cannot find any page protectors, try to order some online. You can also get the pages laminated at a photocopying shop. Once they are laminated, punch holes in them using a hole puncher., Having sections will make your recipe binder less overwhelming. They will also make your binder more organized and easier to browse. Here are some ideas for the different sections you could have in your binder:\n\n\nAppetizers\nBaked goods\nDesserts\nDrinks\nEntrees\nFavorites\nSalads\nSoups\nTreats\n\n, You can design the title page using an image or word processing program. You can also design it right onto a sheet of paper. The title page should include the name of the section in large letters. You can also include a border and a table of contents that lists all the recipes in that section., Again, if you don't have any page protectors, try to get the pages laminated. Be sure to punch holes in the sides., The tabs should match the section title pages. For example, if you have a section title page for desserts, write \"Desserts\" on the tab., Stagger the tabs when you stick them down onto the pages. Each tab should be positioned a little bit lower than the previous tab. That way, you will be able to see all the tabs at once when you open the binder and look down at it., You can put them in any order you want, but make sure that they are under the right sections.\n\n, Recipe binders make great gifts, especially if they are filled with treasured family recipes that have been passed down for generations. They can also make an ideal going-away-to-college gift.\n\n, You can arrange your binder however you think would be the most helpful for you. This section will give you a few ideas on how to do this. You don't have to use all the ideas from this section., If you have a lot of recipes, you could divide them up further between several binders. For example, you can have a binder for baked goods and another one for salads. You could even have a special one just for family recipes., This means that if you have a section for pies, you might arrange your recipes like this: apple pie, blueberry pie, pecan pie, pumpkin pie, rhubarb pie, etc., This can help make your binder look more orderly. It can also help you find recipes quicker. Here are some ideas for you:\n\nAlphabetize the sections. For example: appetizers, beverages, cakes and cookies, desserts, pasta, poultry, salads, etc.\nArrange the sections in the order you might eat a meal. For example: breakfast, lunch, appetizers, salad, main course, dessert, etc.\n\n, This will make finding recipes a lot easier.\n\n\nStart by writing down the name of your recipe book in the top center of the page. Use a large, fancy font.\nNext, write down the names of the sections in a slightly smaller font. You can still use a fancy font. The section names should be on the left side of the page.\nLastly, write down the names of the recipes in a smaller, but plain, font. Make sure that the recipes are under the right section. The recipes should also be on the left.\nIf your binder has page numbers, write them down on the right side. The font should be the same as the one you used for the recipe names.\n\n, If you think you might want to keep adding to your binder, it might be a good idea to include two or three extra pages at the end of each section. This way, if you come across a recipe you like, all you have to do it print it out or write it down. If you are using stationary paper, you won't have to worry about trying to find the same design again., These sections aren't based off of any regular food group, such as soups, salads, cakes, and so forth. They are unique and include dishes from multiple food groups. Here are some examples:\n\nInclude some categories inspired by foods from different countries, such as: Chinese, French, Indian, Italian, Mexican, Thai, etc.Add a section for your favorite recipes.\nPut all of the recipes you are interested in trying out in their own section.\nHave a special section for holiday recipes. This will make finding all of those recipes for Thanksgiving a lot easier., Sometimes, you run out of a certain ingredient and don't have the time to run to the store. Research some common substitutions, and print them out onto a sheet of paper. Add this to the back of your binder.Some common cooking substitutions include margarine for butter and white vinegar for lemon juice.\n\nYou can also include a section for healthy substitutions, such as wheat flour for white flour, or apple sauce instead of oil\/butter., This will come in handy if you are living in the UK and are working with a US recipe, and vice versa. It will also come in handy when you need to measure out liters using cups instead., You can also just use an empty page protector. This is great for those recipes you are not sure about and don't want to put the effort into printing them out just yet., You can tape it to the back of your binder. You can also keep it in its own page protector. This will allow you to keep track of what recipes you have tried and didn't like, so you can avoid using them in the future., You can leave your binder as is, or you can add some special touches to it. This section will give you some ideas. You don't have to use all of the ideas from this section, however. Use the ones you like the most., Stationary paper usually has a pretty boarder. This can make your recipes more interesting to look at.\n\nStationary paper also tends to come in different themes. Choose a theme you like. You can also match the theme to your binder.\nIf you have a special section for holiday recipes, such as Thanksgiving or Christmas, try matching the paper to the holiday. For example, use paper that has pumpkins or autumn leaves for Thanksgiving recipes, and paper that has snowflakes or Christmas trees for Christmas recipes.\n\n, You can add step-by-step pictures to your recipes. You could also add a picture of the final dish instead. This will make the recipes more colorful. The photos will also give you an idea of what the final dish is supposed to look like in the end., You can make a plain binder more interesting by decorating a sheet of paper, and slipping it behind the clear, protective cover. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\nIf you just want a fancy cover, use a sheet of scrapbook paper. You may have to trim it down a little in order to get it to fit.\nGive your binder a title. Write the title down on some paper and slip it behind the protective sheet on the cover. You call it anything you want, such as: You Name's Cookbook.\nUse an opaque fabric marker to draw designs on a fabric-covered binder. Most fabric markers come in opaque and transparent colors. Don't use a transparent fabric marker. The colors will blend right into the fabric and won't show up well.\nIf your binder already has a pattern on it, you could use letter stickers to give it a title.\n\n, This can be a nice way to introduce each section. Here are some ideas\"\n\nIf you have a salad section, add a picture of your favorite salad onto the title page.\nIf you have a section for desserts or pastries, add a picture of a fancy cake or pie.\nIf you have all of the recipes you want in that section, consider adding a mini table of contents. Right beneath the title, write down the names of all the recipes that are in that section. This will help remind you of what is in there.\n\n, This will allow you to get a bit more creative, and match the design of the tab to the rest of your binder. Here's how to make one:\n\nCut some colored paper into a \u00bd by 1 inch (1.27 by 2.54 centimeter) rectangle.\nLabel the tab.\nCut some clear packaging tape into a 1\u00bd by 1\u00bd inch (3.81 centimeter) square\nPlace the \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeter) of the tape onto the side of the page protector.\nPlace the tab under the tape. The long side of the rectangle should flush with the edge of the page protector. It should also be centered on the tape.\nFold the tape over and press it down onto the back of the page protector.\n\n, Using just a few items, you can make your own rustic recipe binder. Here's what you will need:2 sheets thin cardboard or illustration board\nPrinter paper\n2 \u2013 3 binder rings\nMarkers or letter stickers\n\n, Make sure that they are the same size. These will be the front and back cover of your binder., The paper you are using should be a little bit smaller than the covers., You will need two to three holes. The top and bottom hole should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the top and bottom of the covers., Place the back cover down on a table in front of you, then stack the recipe pages on top of it. Place the front cover on top. Align the holes as best you can., Close the binder rings once all the pages, including the covers, are on them. You can buy binder rings from an office supply store or an arts and crafts store., Write a title using marker or letter stickers. You can also draw on a border using markers or glitter paint., Because the binder is made from paper, you will have to take extra care of it. If you are worried about it getting dirty, consider keeping it in a box or in a cupboard.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":617}

{"text":" It's a good idea to have someone to help you \u2014 either an experienced horse person or your veterinarian. You should certainly have an experienced professional supervise you the very first time you give an injection. If your veterinarian can't make the trip, see if a vet tech can help you out.;\n, A needle-shy horse will be able to tell what you're up to, even if he can't see the needle! He'll act up even before getting the shot because he knows what's coming and wants to prevent it. These behaviors can include rearing, biting, and kicking. For everyone's safety in this situation, it's best to have a professional do the job.\n\n\nIf you lack experience, you could end up hurting the horse, even if you escape injury yourself. There's a good chance the needle could bend, possibly while still in the horse. This could damage the horse's muscle, and might even call for surgical removal.\n\n, For example, some horse tranquilizers can cause respiratory arrest (stop breathing) in humans.\n\n, Even sticking the needle through a stopper on a medicine bottle dulls the point a bit. This, in turn, makes the injection more painful for the horse. The needle needs to be as sharp as possible to penetrate the horse's skin quickly and easily. If you encounter a needle-shy horse, he may be that way because of the pain associated with a blunt needle in the past.\n\n, Because muscles have a good blood supply, the medicine is absorbed into the blood stream nicely.\n\n\nSome medications may sting when given IM. The packaging for these products might recommend against giving the medicine through an IM shot. On the other hand, some IM injections contain preservatives that are not suitable for injection into a blood vessel.\nIt's not likely you'll have to give an intravenous injection. Do not attempt one, though, unless you are a qualified veterinarian or vet tech.\n\n, The two most common sites for giving an injection are the neck and hindquarters. Either site is fine \u2014 location is largely a matter of your personal preference. That said, it's best to inject skittish horses in the neck, as you can't get kicked from that position. The large muscle of the hindquarters are better if you need to deliver a large volume of medication (10 ml or more), though.Always check with your vet or the directions on the medication packaging for the recommended injection site.\n\n, The person helping you (the handler) should stand on the same side as of the horse as you. The horse's head should be slightly turned toward the handler. This decreases the chances of someone getting run over or stepped on if the horse reacts badly during the injection process.\n\n\nIt's best not to tie the horse. A big physical reaction could hurt either the horse or the handlers, or damage the equipment.\n\n, Have your handler speak soothingly to the horse while you position yourself by the injection site.If the horse remains restless, try using a twitch to keep him still during the injection. While it may look uncomfortable, a twitch is perfectly safe and humane, and is widely used to ease stress in horses. The most common type of twitch is a loop of rope attached to a pole.\n\n\nPlace the horse's upper lip in the loop of rope.\nTighten the loop by rotating the pole round and round.\nThis gentle compression of the upper lip has a calming effect, like when a mother cat picks up a kitten by the scruff.\nIt is best to have your handler operate the twitch, leaving your hands free to give the injection.\n\n, One of your main concerns when injecting a horse should be the safety of all involved. When injecting at the neck, you stand in a fairly safe position beside the horse's shoulder \u2014 far from kicking back hooves. You also have more control of the horse, as well, since you're by his head. All told, neck injections just provide a safer environment than hindquarter injections, and are a good option.\n\n, Locate the triangle between the point of the horse's shoulder and the slope of the shoulder blade. The upper side of the triangle is the \"nuchal ligament\" \u2014 the arc of muscle along the top of the horse's neck. The lower side of the triangle is formed by the neck bones as they snake upwards from the shoulder in an \"S\" shape.\n\n\nTo find this triangle, put the heel of your hand against the front of the horse's shoulder, about a third of the way up the neck.\nWhere your palm rests is the safe place to give the injection.\n\n, If you give the injection too high up the neck, the medicine will enter the nuchal ligaments that hold the head up. This is extremely painful for the horse, and will continue to cause him pain every time he moves his head. But if you go too low, the needle may glance off the bones of the neck vertebra, which is also painful for the horse.\n\n\nYou could also hit the jugular vein if you go too low. If you're delivering a medication unsuitable for intravenous use, the horse could die.\n\n, This injection site is more effective than the neck, but also more dangerous because you have to stand closer to the back end and the danger of being kicked. However, the hindquarters are the preferred location if you have to deliver a large volume of medication (10 ml or more). For example, penicillin comes in large doses.\n\n, Your target muscle for this type of injection is the \"semitendinosus muscle,\" which is at the very back of the horse's rump. Imagine a horse sitting down like a dog \u2014\u00a0the semitendinosus muscle is the one he would sit on. In foals, this is one of the largest muscles in the body, which adds to its appeal for IM injections.\n\n, Begin by finding the point of the buttocks (the bony bit far back on the pelvis). Drop an imaginary vertical line down to the ground, along the back of the leg. You will give the injection into the bulging muscle located along this line.\n\n\nTake care to inject into the muscle, not into the \"dip\" where the muscle buts against a neighboring one.\nThe \"dip\" is low in blood vessels. Medicine injected there will not be absorbed well, and will be less effective.\n\n, But, the blood supply to this area isn't particularly good, so medicine may be less effective when injected there. Furthermore, if an abscess forms at the needle site, it can be hard to drain off and get rid of.\n\n\nOnly inject in the top of the rump if you have no other options.\n\n, Some people like to tap the horse a few times at the injection site, but this is a bad idea. Taps are fast, punch-like blows given with the heel of the hand before the needle's inserted. Some believe it numbs the skin so the horse won't feel the needle. But, tapping only warns the horse that something is about to happen \u2014 especially if you've used that technique before. The horse will be calmer if he doesn't know what's about to happen.\n\n, When you first insert the needle, you want to do it without the medicine attached to it. This will allow you to \"draw back\" and make sure you've placed the needle accurately.\n\n, Using a sharp, new, sterile needle for each injection, push the needle into the muscle in a smooth, confident motion. The needle should form a 90\u00b0 angle with the muscle. Insert the needle all the way up to the hub (the part where the metal needle joins onto the syringe).\n\n, Many medications can be dangerous for the horse if delivered into a blood vessel. In worst case scenarios, it can result in death. To avoid this, always \"draw back\" before giving an injection. This simple action makes sure your needle is in the muscle, not a blood vessel.\n\n\nOnce you've inserted the needle into the injection site, pull back on the syringe plunger a little bit.\nIf the needle is in a blood vessel, you'll see blood getting pulled into the needle hub (the bit left sticking out of the skin).\nRemove the needle and do NOT inject.\nUse a new, sharp needle to find the injection site again, then repeat the drawing back process until you're confident you're in the right place.\n\n, Draw back on the plunger one more time to double-check for the presence of blood. If all is clear, then press steadily onto the plunger to give the injection. Once the syringe is empty, withdraw the syringe and needle together.\n\n, A blob of blood might form in the needle hole in the horse's skin. If so, apply gentle pressure with a ball of cotton wool for at least two minutes. By that time, the bleeding should have stopped, but if not, keep holding the wool against the wound until it does.\n\n, Once used, they're considered \"clinical waste,\" which means you can't just throw them in the trash. You have to dispose of them in a way approved by local authorities.\n\n\nStore used needles and syringes in a plastic container with a lid. An empty ice-cream tub or similar container will be just fine.\nGive the container to your veterinarian for safe disposal at the clinic.\nMake sure to keep the container out of reach from children while the needles are in your care.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":619}
{"text":";\n, The skin and bone adds thickness to the chicken breasts, essentially doubling the amount of time they need to cook.\n\n, These strips of chicken are very thin, so they usually finish cooking in 10 minutes or less. This amount of time also applies to boneless chicken breast cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces.\n\n, The addition of a bone adds more cooking time to this cut. Moreover, as dark meat, thighs need to cook for a little longer than breasts.\n\n, Since drumsticks have less meat on them than thighs, they do not usually need to cook for quite as long.\n\n, Add another 10 to 20 minutes onto the cooking time for each additional 1 lb (450 g).\n\n, The exact size stockpot you need may vary depending on how large your chicken pieces are and how much room they take up inside the pot. As a general rule, the chicken should take up roughly 1\/4 to 1\/3 of the space in your stockpot.\n\n\nAn 8-quart (8-liter) stockpot is fairly standard and will usually be enough to hold a whole chicken. A larger stockpot may be needed for birds bigger than 4 lb (1800 g), though.\nYou can use an 8-quart (8-liter) stockpot for boneless chicken breasts, but you could also opt for a smaller stockpot so that the water will boil faster.\n\n, Pour enough cold water into the stockpot to cover the chicken completely.\n\n\nCold water is preferable to warm water.\n\n, You can sprinkle anywhere from 1 tsp (5 ml) to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) salt into the water. A smaller amount is better for boneless chicken breasts and chicken tenders, but a larger amount may be better for whole chickens.\n\n\nNote that the salt is only optional. You could boil the chicken without salt, but it will be much blander as a result.\n\n, Cover the stockpot and boil the chicken on medium heat. Follow the recommended cooking time listed in this article for your cut of chicken.\n\n, Place enough chicken broth into your stockpot to fill the stockpot halfway.\n\nChicken broth intensifies the flavor of the chicken, so it becomes less bland than chicken boiled in water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use pre-made broth, but if you do not have pre-made broth, you can combine chicken broth granules with water. You usually need 1 tsp (5 ml) or one cube of chicken bouillon per 1 cup (250 ml) of water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse chicken stock instead of broth for an even richer, deeper flavor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Cutting the vegetables up allows more of the flavor to seep into the cooking liquid.\n\nPeel the onions and cut them into halves or quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWash the carrots with water and slice them into 1-inch (2.5-cm) coins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRinse the celery and cut it into 1-inch (2.5-cm) slices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Transfer the chopped vegetables to the stockpot. The vegetables add dimension to the flavor of the broth.\n\n\nStrictly speaking, the vegetables are not needed. Chicken can be boiled in plain broth.\n\n, Transfer the chicken to the stockpot. If necessary, add more broth or water to the stockpot so that the chicken is completely covered.\n\n, Bring the broth the a boil over high heat. Cover the pot, and reduce the heat to medium or medium-low so that the chicken simmers slowly.\n\n\nCook according to the recommended cooking times listed in this article.\nRemove the chicken with tongs or a slotted spoon when done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf desired, strain the cooking liquid and save the broth as stock for future recipes. You can store stock in the refrigerator for 3 days or in the freezer for 2 months.\nYou will likely end up discarding the vegetables used in this recipe, since the texture will turn mushy. The primary purpose of the vegetables in this recipe is to add flavor, not to serve as a side dish.\n\n, Pile the chicken into your stockpot and cover with enough water and apple juice to completely cover the chicken.\n\nFor a stronger apple flavor, pour 2 quarts (2 liters) of apple juice into the stockpot before filling the rest of the stockpot up with enough water to cover the chicken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a more subtle apple flavor, pour equal parts apple juice and water into the stockpot simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could also use apple cider instead of apple juice. Apple cider tends to have a sharper taste, which some find preferable to the milder taste of apple juice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the combination of chicken, water, and apple juice fills between 1\/2 and 3\/4 of the stockpot.\n\n, The savory taste of the vegetables in this recipe balances out the natural sweetness of the apple juice.\n\nPeel the onion and cut it into halves or quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRinse the carrots under running water and cut them into 1-inch (2.5-cm) coins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using cloves of garlic, mince 4 cloves of garlic. If using garlic powder, use 1\/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of the seasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use anywhere between 1 tsp (5 ml) and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) chopped fresh thyme. If using dried thyme, cut this down to 1\/3 the amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Disperse the onion, carrots, garlic, and thyme in the apple juice mixture.\n\n, Bring the liquid up to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat so that the liquid only simmers, then cover and let cook according to the amount of time indicated in the \"cooking times\" section.\n\n, About 10 minutes before the chicken finishes cooking, begin preparing the apple. Peel the apple, core it, and cut it into small slices.\n\n\nThe addition of the apple near the end of the cooking time will infuse an even stronger apple flavor into the chicken.\n\n, Strain out the chicken when done and serve without any of the vegetables, fruit, seasonings, or cooking liquid.\n\n\nThe other ingredients serve to infuse the chicken with flavor as it cooks. The ingredients themselves, however, will be too soft and mushy to be very appetizing at this point.\n\n, Add the dry white wine and chicken broth first. Then, fill the pot with enough water to reach the halfway point.\n\nWine can infuse chicken meat with a tremendous amount of flavor, but using too much could be overpowering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly use chicken broth in equal parts with the wine. Otherwise, the flavor of the chicken broth could end up competing with the flavor of the wine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDilute with water only as necessary.\n\n, Toss the pearl onions, salt, pepper, garlic, parsley, oregano, and thyme into the cooking liquid.\n\n\nPearl onions do not need to be cut beforehand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not have pre-minced garlic on hand, you could mince or crush 6 cloves of garlic instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using fresh herbs, add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of each herb. For dried herbs, cut this amount down to 1 tsp (5 ml) each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Bring the cooking liquid up to a boil over medium-high heat. Let sit at this temperature for 2 to 5 minutes before reducing to a simmer.\n\n\nDoing this allows some of the flavor of the seasoning to be released and some of the bitterness of the wine to cook off.\n\n, Add the chicken to the cooking liquid using tongs. Bring the liquid back up to a boil before reducing the heat again.\n\n, Cover the stockpot and boil the chicken at a steady simmer for the recommended cooking time indicated.\n\n\nServe the chicken only. The liquid and other ingredients are meant to add flavor, not to be served alongside the chicken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":620}
{"text":" Gluten is found in foods made with grains, like breads, pastas and snacks containing wheat, rye,barley and malt. The gluten in oats is still under investigation as to whether is has the same effect on the body. Any kind of flour can contain gluten.\n\n\nSome foods you can eat are those made of corn, buckwheat, nuts and legumes, rice, potato, and millet.\n\n, The obvious offenders are breads and pastas, but beer, various condiments, boxed foods and bakery items may contain gluten as well.\n\n, With the new requirements of listing allergy information on labels, all products containing wheat or gluten should be advertised as such. Look for the nutrition box on the packaging; the ingredients list and allergy information are usually in the same vicinity. Read all the fine print.\n\n\nThis is important because some processed foods like bouillon cubes, french fries, and even soy sauce may contain gluten.\n\n, If you don't see any, ask your server if there are any dishes that aren't made with gluten. If your server doesn't know, the chef or manager on duty should be able to find the information for you. Your knowledge of gluten products will come in handy here.\n\n,, If you do not do so you run the risk of developing severe and potentially life-threatening complications such as other autoimmune disorders, intestinal cancer, anemia, liver disease, hypoglycemia, and bone diseases.\n\n, You may be able to participate in a clinical trial as well. A daily multivitamin can help give you the nutrients you need.

{"text":" You lose weight when you burn more calories than you eat, so an inactive person who eats a lot of food will likely gain weight. The first step to losing weight is eating fewer calories. Track how many calories you eat in a day by writing down calorie information on all the food and drinks you consume. For foods that don't have nutrition labels, use the USDA Food Database to look up how many calories the item has.Find out how many calories your body needs to maintain your current weight by using an online calculator that takes your activity level into account. Try this one online www.bmrcalculator.org\/.\nA pound of fat has 3,500 calories in it.To lose a pound of fat each week, every day you should eat 500 calories less than what your body needs to maintain its current weight.;\n, When you eat too much food, your body turns it into fat and stores it for future use. Read food labels to find out what an appropriate serving size should be. If you want to eat something without a label, check the American Dietetic Association Food Exchange list for proper serving sizes.Use measuring cups and a kitchen scale to make sure your servings match the recommended portion size.\nRestaurants can be tricky because they usually serve extremely large portion sizes. Some restaurants post their nutrition information online, though. If possible, check the nutrition information beforehand and plan a meal between 500\u2013600 calories.\nRemember that you never have to eat the whole plate. Eat half your food to reach your calorie goal, then save the rest for later. You may be able to ask your server to put half of your meal in a to-go box before bringing out your food.\nSome restaurants also have lighter menu options or half-portion sizes of their larger meals. Order off of this lighter menu whenever possible.\n\n, Healthy fats like unsaturated oils should be the primary fat source in your diet. Cook with olive or canola oil instead of butter or lard. Other sources of healthy fats include nuts, seeds, avocados, fish, and natural peanut butter. Don't eat anything that has trans fat or lists the words \u201cpartially hydrogenated\u201d in the ingredients list. You should avoid saturated fats as much as possible, limiting them to less than 10% of your total calories.\n\n\nTo calculate total calories from saturated fat, multiply the grams of fat by nine. For example, a food item with 5 grams of saturated fat has 45 calories from saturated fat.\nDivide these calories by your total calories for the day, then multiply by 100. You want this final number to be less than 10.\nFor example, if I ate 210 calories from saturated fat and 2,300 calories for the day, I would have eaten 9% of calories from saturated fat.\n\n, Processed foods go through some type of processing in a factory, and are usually found packaged in boxes, cans, bags, or other packaging. Often (although not always) they are higher in fat, sugar, and salt that can prevent you from losing weight. They also can lack a lot of the nutrients found in whole foods. Slowly eliminate processed foods from your diet by cutting two to three processed items per day. Replace them with whole foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.\n\n\nHighly processed foods are an indicator it may be high in undesirable food qualities.\nBut just because a food is processed does not necessarily mean that is the case. There are many foods that are in packages that are quite good on a healthy diet, such as frozen vegetables, frozen fish fillets, or popcorn.\nAlso be aware that food that did not come from a bag, box, or the like may still be unhealthy. A chocolate brownie made from organic ingredients from scratch is still a brownie.\nAt the store, avoid the processed foods in the aisles by mainly shopping the perimeter, where the produce, dairy, meat and seafood, and bakery are. Only choose select items that are low-processed from aisles like the cooking aisle.\nMake meals from scratch ahead of time and freeze them into portion sizes to be eaten during the week. Homemade soups with tons of vegetables are a great freezer option.Look for foods that have three or fewer ingredients on the ingredients list to avoid highly processed items.\n\n, It has many health benefits, including keeping your digestive tract healthy, and keeping you feeling full longer so you don't overeat. Fiber is found in whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and nuts and seeds. Eat 25-30 grams of fiber each day with plenty of water.\n\n\nFruits that are high in fiber include raspberries, blackberries, mango, and guava.\nVegetables that are high in fiber include split peas, lentils, artichokes, and broccoli.\n\n, Water is a major player in weight control. It helps flush metabolic waste out of your system, keeping your metabolism running high to quickly burn fat. Water will also keep you feeling full so you don't overeat. The adequate intake for men is 3 liters of water each day (about 13 cups) while women should drink 2.2 liters per day (about 9 cups).\n\n\nIf you take part in high activity exercise or cardio during the day or live in a very hot climate, you may need to increase your water intake.\n\n, Instead of eating three large meals each day, eat six smaller ones. Your body can process food better in smaller amounts, resulting in less excess food being stored as fat. This can also steady your blood sugar levels and improve your absorption of vitamins and minerals.Just make sure these smaller meals are are made up of healthy, whole foods instead of processed food. You might consider this sample meal plan:\n\n\nMeal #1 (8 a.m.): One medium banana with \u00bd cup of oatmeal.\nMeal #2 (10 a.m.): A smoothie made with 1 cup of spinach, four medium strawberries, \u2153 cup of raspberries, 1 tbsp of flaxseed, and 8 fl oz of unsweetened almond milk.\nMeal #3 (12 p.m.): One slice of whole wheat toast topped with one boiled egg and \u00bc cup of mashed avocado.\nMeal #4 (3 p.m.): 1 cup of salad topped with \u00bd avocado, \u00bc cup cottage cheese, 2 tbsp of sunflower seeds, and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing.\nMeal #5 (5 p.m.): 4 oz of baked chicken with a side of green beans and \u00bd cup of brown rice.\nMeal #6 (7 p.m.): \u00bd cup of cooked quinoa mixed with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and pepper.\n\n, To achieve the best fat-burning results, start out by exercising for two hours and 30 minutes each week, then increasing it by 30 minutes every week. Combining both weightlifting and high intensity cardio is the best way to maximize fat-burning. Consider following this sample four-week workout schedule:\n\n\nSundays: Week One \u2014 45 min. Cardio; Week Two \u2014 45 min. Cardio; Week Three \u2014 60 min. Cardio; Week Four \u2014 60 min.

Try mixing up strength training exercises that work different muscle parts in the body. Start out at a slightly difficult weight or resistance and do three sets of 10 for each exercise or until failure. Once you can do that weight three workouts in a row (full three sets of 10) without failing, increase the weight or resistance by one level.\n\n\nExercises for the lower body include squats, calf raises, lunges, deadlifts, and leg press.\nUpper body exercises include push-ups, sit-ups, chest press, overhead press, bicep curls, tricep dips, and lateral pull-downs.\n\n, Cardio speeds up fat-burning, but it also has many other health benefits including decreasing your risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\nRunning, jogging or walking: If you start out walking, make it your goal to work up to jogging, then running.\nEnjoy outdoor activities like sports, swimming, hiking, and biking.\nIf you belong to a gym, use its treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and stair climbers.\nTry interval exercises, like multiple sprints with jogging in between.\nSwitch between high intensity cardio and slower\/longer endurance cardio for maximum fat burning.\n\n, This is because lack of sleep causes changes in metabolism and fat-burning.These tips can help you get a good night\u2019s sleep:Make sure the room is completely dark with dark curtains or sheets over the window.\nDo not eat for at least two hours before going to bed in order to prevent heartburn or an increase in energy when you are trying to go to sleep.\nOnly use your bed for sleeping and sex. Do not do other activities such as watching TV, reading, listening to music, or working on the computer while you are in bed.\n\n, Making small lifestyle changes throughout the day will help make your new habits stick. In the end, you will have made a positive change to a healthier lifestyle that you will be able to maintain long-term. Some small gestures you can make throughout the day to make a healthy lifestyle change include:\n\n\nTake the stairs instead of the elevator.\nPark in the back of the parking lot.\nStart a hobby that involves you moving around, like hiking or biking.\nGo to a weekly farmer\u2019s market to buy fresh produce.\nStart a garden of your own.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":622}

{"text":" For cooking pizza and cookies, the top rack in the center is the ideal location. For cooking bread, biscuits, and other items, the middle rack in the center is the better choice.;\n, Never put a cold pizza stone in a hot oven, as it can shatter due to thermal shock.In fact, make sure never to expose the pizza stone to rapid temperature shifts. Placing a frozen pizza on a pizza stone is almost as likely to result in a shattered stone as placing a cold stone in a hot oven. You're better off cooking your frozen pizza straight on the rack.\n\n,, Do not grease or oil. For breads and pizza crust, you may want to add a little cornmeal to aid removal.\n\n\nIt can take a little finessing to get used to, but a pizza paddle is a useful instrument, especially for transferring uncooked pizza dough onto the stone. There are three different kinds of peels \u2014 short-handled wooden peels, long-handled wooden peels, and metal peels. For the average person cooking at home, the short-handled wooden peel will probably work best.\nIf you don't want to use cornmeal under your dough, you can also use flour. Rice flour is a great way to ensure the dough doesn't stick to your paddle., You do not have to remove it at all, as it can add to a \"brick oven effect\" that actually helps your oven retain and spread heat more evenly. You can put cooking dishes, pots, pans, cookie trays, and so on right on the stone.\n\n, Of course, only do this once you're sure the pizza stone is cool enough to handle.\n\n, The pizza stone can be cleaned and rinsed entirely with water. With a clean sponge, wipe away any remaining food or grime using only water. Do not try to remove oils that build up \u2014 it is fully unnecessary. Leaving the oils on the stone actually helps season the stone, turning it into a slicker, more easy-to-use item.\n\n, A simple once-over is probably more than enough. If you pizza stone happens to absorb too much moisture when it's soaking in the sink, it can crack the next time you heat it in the oven., Stains on your pizza stone are normal and almost unavoidable. Moreover, they're like a badge of honor, or experience points \u2014 something that you point to as a vindication of your cooking skills.\n\n, You can house your pizza stone in the oven even as you bake other items. Just bake them on top of the stone itself. For heavier items, like a roast, move the pizza stone to the bottom rack before cooking.\n\n, You should know how much space you have to work with before you select your stone. You'll be kicking yourself if you buy a stone and then realize that your oven isn't large enough for it.\n\n, If you're a bottom line sort of person and only worried about the taste of your pizza, not the look of your stone, you can purchase a quarry stone for around $5 to $10. You can start your search at any home improvement store like Home Depot or Lowe's.\n\n\nLook for clay or shale tiles, specifically, when you search for your stone.
